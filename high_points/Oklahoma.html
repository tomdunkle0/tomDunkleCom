                    The town of Kenton, Oklahoma, near the state's high point of Black Mesa,
                    feels like a true wild western ghost town. We didn't see signs of any
                    inhabitants while passing through, but I believe that there are some.
                    <br><br>
                    The Black Mesa is actually a large formation that exists in three different
                    states: Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Colorado. Unsurprisingly, much of the mesa
                    in New Mexico is at a higher elevation than the Oklahoma state high point.
                    There are also several New Mexican mountains visible from Black Mesa that
                    are huge by comparison.

                    The canyon views became impressive as we ascended the mesa. It took just
                    a couple hours' time to summit the mesa and return. The funny part of the climb
                    was getting on top of the mesa and seeing the large monument marking the high
                    point about a half mile away, across what looked like a flat field.
                    <br><br>
                    In fact, when we were in the center of the mesa, I almost couldn't tell that I
                    was on top of it. Looking in the distance, the horizon would just show a thin
                    sliver of the canyon around the mesa.

                    A short trail connected the high point monument to an overlook of Kenton and
                    the surrounding landscape. After we downed our celebratory gin and tonics for
                    completing the high point, we went out to the vantage point to take in the
                    view.
