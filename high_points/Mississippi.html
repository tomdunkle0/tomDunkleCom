                    Mississippi's Woodall Mountain is a rural scene in the northeastern corner
                    of the state. I took the Natchez Trace Parkway there all the way from Jackson.
                    The summit features a High Pointer's Bench, a mailbox register, and a couple
                    of nondescript telecomms buildings. There is also a plaque discussing the
                    history of the mountain (see Figure 5 at the bottom of the page).

                    As the name suggests, Woodall Mountain Road leads to the summit of Woodall
                    Mountain. To keep things fresh and interesting, I did an inverted climb of
                    the mountain. I drove my car to the top, parked it, walked down to the bottom,
                    and then back up.

                    Woodall Mountain Road is a dirt road, and there are a few little driveways
                    off of it. One of the driveways was, according to a posted sign, for a local
                    hunting club. The area is peaceful and quiet, and I don't think I saw anybody
                    else there. The road gets steep for just a couple hundred feet near the
                    end, but it's a pretty low grade up until then.
