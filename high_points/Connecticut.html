                    Connecticut is my home state, and it represents itself in the sport of
                    highpointing the same way that it does in other walks of life--by making
                    everything needlessly complicated and refusing to fit the model. Rather
                    than one highest mountain peak, Connecticut has a highest mountain peak
                    and a true highest point that's on the hillside along the slope of a
                    taller mountain in Massachusetts. Fortunately, the two points are close
                    enough to make it easy to hit both in one go.
                    <br><br>
                    There's a lying sign on top of Bear Mountain claiming the highest point
                    in the state. The sign's carved into the side of a boulder, the top of
                    which provides excellent views. Connecticut is extremely wooded in a way
                    that I was never conscious of as a kid but that I always notice now when
                    I visit as an adult who's moved away. These debated high points give you
                    a sense of it. Nowhere else besides an airplane can you really look down
                    on the patchwork quilt of forests that cover the land the way that you
                    can here.

                    Mt. Frissell's summit is wooded and marked, but if you turn around and walk
                    about a fifth of a mile, you'll come to a rock in the ground with a turqoise
                    geographical marker in it. That's the true and correct high point of the
                    state, and from there you can only get more Yankee if you drop your fried
                    clams on the ground (not pictured).

                    This was a humid, sweaty high point. With it in the books,
                    I've completed every state in the New England region.

                    The forests of Connecticut are perhaps the environment that I'm the most
                    familiar with. Exploring these spaces is what taught me to love being outside,
                    and it's the root of my quest to summit the 50 state high points. The woods
                    are vastly different depending on the time of year, and while summer's
                    probably the most picturesque it's not the most comfortable. It's hot, muggy,
                    and damp. But with this high point in the books, I had completed every state
                    in the New England region.
