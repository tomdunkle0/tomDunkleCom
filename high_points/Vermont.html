                    Mt. Mansfield is a relatively steep climb, but it doesn't last long.
                    It took us just a couple of hours to summit the mountain and return.
                    Despite doing this late in the season, we had a day with clear weather
                    and it was perfect. The snow covering the upper half of the mountain
                    contrasts with the fall colors in the trees below the snow line.
                    <br><br>
                    The summit of Mt. Mansfield is a rocky dome that's covered in snow, albeit
                    with a marked trail crossing it. The summit can be reached from two trails.

                    The clouds had a way of continually engulfing the summit, and this created
                    a dynamic viewing experience as certain places disappeared in the clouds
                    while others come into view.

                               on the Long Trail. Is that accurate?

                    Just like when conquering New York's Mt. Marcy the day before, there was
                    a unique contrast of seasons on Mt. Mansfield. Most of the mountain was
                    above the 'season line' and therefore covered in snow, but the forests
                    at the base of the mountain and in the surrounding land showed the
                    familiar warmer colors of a New England autumn.
                    <br><br>
                    Several parts of Mt. Mansfield are named after body parts, implying that
                    the mountain itself resembles a human face. The summit is called "The
                    Chin", and "The Adam's Apple" is a protruding feature slightly lower
                    along one of the mountain's ridges. Just below the Adam's Apple is the
                    Lake of the Clouds, as seen in Figures 6 and 7.
