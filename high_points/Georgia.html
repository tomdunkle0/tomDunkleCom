                    Georgia's Brasstown Bald is located in the mountainous Appalachian region in
                    the north of the state. The mountain can be summited on foot from a few
                    different directions, or you can drive to parking lot that's a short hike
                    from the summit, but personally I don't like to live that way. No disrespect
                    if you do.
                    <br><br>
                    I climbed this mountain with my brother Bill, and we started in the town of
                    Young Harris, at the trailhead on Bald Mountain Road. We descended the
                    mountain via the Arkaquah Trailhead. The whole journey took about six hours,
                    so it's a hike but it's nothing too crazy.

                    There's a pretty large building and observation deck at the summit of the
                    mountain. Since I visited during the COVID-19 pandemic, the facility was
                    closed but people were still able to access the deck. The deck provided
                    views of all of the surrounding landmarks with the exception of occasional
                    cloud obstruction.

                    The trail was mostly covered in leaves, being that it was November and the
                    trees had finished shedding. It's also rural Georgia, so the air is alive
                    with gunshots from every direction in the distance. We didn't see much at all
                    in the way of wildlife, and that's probably a good thing because I'd be
                    concerned about running into a bear here.

                    The overcast weather that we had that day gave the mountains an almost purple
                    tint. As the clouds danced around, different parts of the landscape were
                    periodically hidden from view. At times, everything below us disappeared.
