                    Massachusetts had received a snowstorm a couple of days before we climbed
                    Mt. Greylock. The climb itself happened in nice, clear weather, but we
                    had to do it in deep snow which slowed us down a bit. Perhaps the least
                    favorable element of the day was the New England sunset, which happens
                    as early as 4:00pm in the winter. We did end up coming part of the way
                    down in the dark.
                    <br><br>
                    At the summit is a large tower that looks like a chess pawn. Although most
                    of the trail was in clear conditions, the top of the mountain was extremely
                    foggy. I captured one cool video of the tower slowly fading into view as
                    I walked closer to it.

                    The rest of the summit was a snowy field dotted with evergreens, and one side
                    open for a view that we couldn't see much of due to the fog. Obviously, I'd
                    rank this mountain relatively low on the difficulty scale of US high points,
                    but it packs a surprising punch when you have to climb it in deep snow.
                    Maybe it's good practice for that same sort of feature on a more serious
                    mountain like Mt. Hood or Mt. Rainier.

                    In the days between the snowstorm and our group climbing the mountain, a few
                    others had also made the trek. This made the trail easier to follow, as
                    slushy footprints lined it all the way up. For a good seasonal contrast of
                    the northeast, look at my photos of the Connecticut high point(s) next. They
                    are very close to Mt. Greylock, but I did them in the summer.

                    On this trip I was joined by my friends Randall and Lars, in addition to the
                    usual suspects. They're the two leftmost people in the panorama at the top of
                    the page. We saw a couple of other people along the trail, both locals, but
                    otherwise there was not a lot of human activity. Just a bit too dreary and
                    snowy of a day for most people, I guess.

                    The snowy woods of New England are calm and serene, but there isn't much
                    to talk about besides trees, snow, and clouds. So, I'll point out some
                    interesting trees. There's a bowed tree that's almost fallen over (Figure 8),
                    a stripped tree that may have been hit by lightning (Figure 9), and a fallen
                    tree (Figure 10). And if you search the photos hard enough, you'll find many
                    more trees.
