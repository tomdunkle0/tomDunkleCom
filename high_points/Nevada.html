                    Boundary Peak is named so because the state line between Nevada and California
                    runs through the saddle between Boundary Peak and the neighboring Montgomery
                    Peak. The trailhead is somewhat remote--accessible only with 4WD vehicles via a
                    network of unpaved roads that climb the nearby foothills. Because we drove from
                    Colorado to Las Vegas in my Honda Civic, we used Turo to rent a Jeep in order
                    to get to the trailhead. That turned out to be the right move. The only
                    gambling we did in Vegas was deciding to leave my car overnight in a free
                    parking garage in a mall where there were no signs saying we couldn't do so.
                    I'm happy to say that nobody messed with my car.

                    Camping was easily do-able at the trailhead or at plenty of spots along the
                    road. We found a great spot and set up outside of the Jeep, with plenty of time
                    for a Mountain House beef stroganoff meal, an evening full of Irish drinking
                    songs on a Bluetooth speaker, and a reasonably early bedtime of 10:30pm. A
                    herd of cows were grazing near the campsite, which got awkward when I also ate
                    some leftover steak from a Hawaiian BBQ place in Vegas.

                    In the morning, we hiked first along the trail as it runs adjacent to a small
                    creek called Trail Creek. After only about 20 to 30 minutes of hiking, the
                    trail diverges from the creek and leads into the valley below Boundary Peak
                    (whose true summit is not yet visible).

                    There are two common approaches to the summit of Boundary Peak. The official
                    trail proceeds from the end of Trail Creek through the valley and then ascends
                    the mountain at a very steep angle, with switchbacks so frequent that the trail
                    looks like a zig-zag line going up the mountain. Based on advice in the
                    AllTrails reviews from previous climbers, we opted instead to bushwhack across
                    the right side of the valley and hike straight up the Trail Canyon Saddle until
                    we met up with the Queens Canyon Trail. That trail then took us straight up to
                    the summit on the opposite side of the ridge as the official trail.

                    Once on top of the saddle, we took our first food break. As it turns out, this
                    hike divides almost perfectly into three parts, and at this point we were done
                    with the first part. From here, the Queens Canyon Trail clearly went up at a
                    steep angle from the saddle towards a bigger foothill. We joked about how
                    obvious it was that what we were seeing at that point was a false summit.

                    the beginning of this page). It was an amazing thing to see in person. At this
                    point, leg two of the hike was complete. We hung out on some rocks eating jerky
                    and dried fruit, contemplating how steep the trail ahead looked. But, we

                    It wasn't as bad as we'd feared, although there was quite a lot of boulder
                    scrambling to get to the top. There are never any real cliffs on this hike.
                    Nowhere you could get killed with one false move, but it's still very hard work
                    climbing up boulders this size at such a steep angle.

                    Right next to the summit of Boundary Peak are two large rock formations that
                    look like druids engaging in a ceremony. They came closer and closer into our
                    view as we approached the summit. From this angle, the one on the right looks
                    like a druid kneeling down, while the one on the left looks like he's accepting
                    some sort of offering from the one on the right. Or... maybe it even looks like
                    a marriage proposal. Very interesting visual.

                    At the summit are two different geographic markers. And, confusingly, neither
                    of them seems to be on the highest rock on the summit. But either way, it's
                    definitely the highest point in Nevada. As with many of the state high points,
                    there's a box full of notebooks and comments from previous climbers to look
