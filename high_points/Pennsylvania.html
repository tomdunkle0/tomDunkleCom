                    After pounding beers and eating pizza in the mine fire ghost town of Centralia,
                    we visited the Mt. Davis Natural Area in Pennsylvania to find a spot to set up
                    camp. The forest in this area is one of the strangest forests I've ever been
                    in. Even in late May, everything looks dead. The trees were dotted with some
                    small green leaves, but only just enough to make me question whether they
                    really were dead. Everywhere I looked, fallen trees lined the ground. I
                    wondered whether there was some plague infesting the woods.

                    The summit of the mountain is below treeline, and the geographic marker for
                    the high point is on top of a pointy boulder at the summit. Nearby are several
                    informational boards on the history of the mountain, as well as an observation
                    tower.
                    <br><br>
                    At one point along the trail, we all heard a loud snapping sound from directly
                    above. I looked up, and for about a tenth of a second I thought that a huge
                    bird was taking off from a tree branch above us. Then it occurred to me that
                    there was no bird, and that a large tree branch had just separated from its
                    tree and was falling directly onto us. Ry sidestepped and just barely avoided
                    being hit in the face by this huge tree branch. Based on this encounter, we've
                    all agreed that Pennsylvania is the most dangerous high point we've done.

                    There was one spot along the trail where we had to stop the listen to two
                    woodpeckers dueling. They were occupying two neighboring trees, and whenever
                    one of them started pecking, the other one felt the need to respond.
