                    From my home in Austin, Texas, I took a trip all the way up north to check off
                    the high points of North and South Dakota, with a detour over to Fraser,
                    Colorado on the way to meet up with my friends Ry and Aaron. At the time, the
                    Dakotas were two of the small handful of states I'd never even been to before.
                    <br><br>
                    After driving seven hours from Fraser, through Wyoming and into South
                    Dakota, we parked at the Black Elk Peak trailhead in Custer State Park.
                    In jest, I noted that Custer (and state parks in general) are cool and all,
                    but I prefer it when state high points are not in the middle of them.

                    The Black Hills are a unique landscape. The rocks are both pointy and smooth,
                    depending on how close you're viewing them from. They're no Rocky Mountains,
                    but the hills contrast with the mostly flat landscape in the surrounding areas,
                    and they present tons of opportunity for rock climbers. Visiting here made
                    me think about getting more serious with rope climbing. More on that later.

                    The trail is about three miles long, and it's mostly horizontal. There's an arc
                    in the trail, and we were joking that it would be faster to just run down into
                    the valley and cut across. Looking back at the map now, that definitely would
                    not have saved time, though I'm sure it would have been fun.

                    The summit of Black Elk Peak is a tall rock spire, similar to other rocks
                    in the area, but there is an observation tower constructed on top of
                    it. Without the tower, I suspect it'd still be easily climbable, but there's
                    a manmade walkway and staircase that leads you up through the inside of
                    the rock, which makes the approach a bit more exciting. At the top of the
                    stairs, just before entering the tower is a plaque indicating the mountain's
                    height and pointing out that it's the highest point east of the Rocky
                    Mountains and west of Europe. The plaque also illustrates that the mountain
                    used to be called Harney Peak, before it was renamed in 2016.

                    Inside the observation tower is a lofted deck that you can climb up to
                    and see out the windows. It's a nifty little feature, but the views
                    are cooler if you just stand on the deck outside the building. The stairs
                    to get up to the loft are also steep and sketchy.

                    leads you down to a small lake hidden on the side of the hill, with a concrete

                    From the lake, each of us climbed in a different direction up the surrounding
                    rocks. From where I stood, I took the pictures in Figures 19-21 and made a
                    comic strip of Ry and Aaron climbing the watchtower. It's hard to see
                    them in the last frame, since they and the tower are in the shadows.

                    About 300 feet south of Black Elk Peak is a steep peg of a mountain called
                    McGillicuddy's Peak. Clearly one of the more technical summits in South
                    Dakota, it's steep enough to require rope climbing (skills I do not
                    possess yet).
                    <br><br>
                    As we stood on the tower on Black Elk peak, I started fearing that maybe
                    McGillicuddy's is actually the taller of the two at its natural point, and
                    that maybe people just got lazy and built the tower on the easier peak to
                    reach. But no, when I looked it up later I learned that the latest measurements
                    show McGillicuddy's is less than two feet shorter than Black Elk Peak, at their
                    highest natural points.
                    <br><br>
                    Highpointers everywhere dodged a bullet on this one. South Dakota may end up
                    being one of the most technical climbs if two feet of Black Elk Peak ever
                    get shaved off in a storm. On the way down, Ry and I took a detour over to the
                    base of McGillicuddy's to get a closer look and confirm that there was no way
                    in hell we could climb it.
