                    Minnesota's Eagle Mountain is surprisingly close to the north shore of
                    Lake Superior. It's not a huge mountain, but it's in the middle of
                    lake-dotted wilderness that's characteristic of Minnesota and pleasant to
                    explore.

                    The summit features a geographic marker and a plaque documenting the history
                    of the mountain's survey. The plaque is engraved in a rock in the ground.
                    The summit is in a wooded area populated by grouse, which make eery sounds.

                    The Eagle Mountain Trail passes through lakes and wetlands, and in many places
                    there are wooden footbridges to help you get through the wetter parts. It
                    seemed excessive at times, but I guess in a land like this you just can't
                    always find a dry path between two points.
                    <br><br>
                    Also, as was the case in each of the four Great Lakes area states I did on
                    this trip, there were a ton of bugs in the air. The 'black flies' of Minnesota
                    are active this time of year, and the bug nets we wore were useful. Flies are
                    really stupid. They urge to bite your face, but even a loose piece of fabric
                    as coverage prevents them from figuring out how to get to your skin.

                    Eagle Mountain is only about two miles from the coast of Lake Superior, which
                    demonstrated the calmest water I've ever seen. After we finished climbing the
                    mountain, Ry and I found a 'cart-in' campsite nearby where some wooden carts
                    were left to allow you to bring your camping gear from the parking lot to the
                    lake shore. We found a campsite where there were enough hot embers still
                    burning in the fire pit for us to start a new fire even without a lighter.

                    The summit is wooded and not the most scenic part of the trail. The most scenic
                    part is the vantage point from which Figures 10-12 were taken, which was about
                    a quarter of a mile from the summit.
