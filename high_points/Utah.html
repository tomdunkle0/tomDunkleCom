                    King's Peak is in the Uinta Mountain range, about twelve miles out from the
                    Henry's Fork trailhead. Because of its remoteness (at least relative to other
                    state high points), climbing King's Peak is a grueling task that most take
                    multiple days to complete. I did so across three days with my brother Bill and
                    our friends Ry and Victoria. In total, we covered approximately 31 miles across
                    18 hours of hiking.

                    On day one, we hit the trail around 4:00pm and carried all of our gear for
                    eight miles to get to Dollar Lake. We established our campsite almost exactly
                    four hours after we'd started, in a small patch of woods a stone's throw from
                    the trail. We all looked forward to leaving most of the gear at the campsite
                    on day two so that we could carry lighter packs. Dollar Lake was our source of
                    water for much of the trip, and when filtered, the lake water was surprisingly
                    good.
                    <br><br>
                    The trail goes south through a valley north of King's Peak that looks
                    suspiciously like the overworld of a 1990s role-playing game, and is
                    surrounded by red, blocky, banded peaks with a vague Lego aesthetic. King's
                    Peak is visible from this valley, but just at one specific angle as a backdrop
                    to two closer peaks.

                    On the morning of day two, we set out with significantly less weight to carry
                    than the day before, and we finished crossing the valley to get to Gunsight
                    Pass. Gunsight Pass is a channel into another, perhaps even more beautiful
                    valley east of King's Peak. The east valley is also bordered by South King's
                    Peak, and a long, steep scree slope on the opposite side. There are several
                    small lakes in the valley, which we had spectacular views of as we proceeded
                    towards the peak. Near the end of this valley, the trail brought us right up
                    to the edge of King's Peak, so that we could get a good look at the ridge we
                    were about to traverse. It's at this point that you started being able to see
                    other climbers on the ridge if you squint (or, zoom in if you're viewing
                    photos).

                    The north ridge of King's Peak begins at Anderson Pass. When we reached
                    Anderson Pass, we were rewarded with our first views of the valley that's
                    west of King's Peak. It's a sharp, crescent-shaped valley that sits
                    peacefully in the protection of Utah's highest point, collecting scree from
                    the surrounding hills.
                    <br><br>
                    Interestingly, the whole north ridge seemed to be a haven for butterflies the
                    day we were there. Hundreds of butterflies zipped past me throughout the climb.
                    It was hard to get photos without butterflies bombing them, so every shot you
                    see here is one of several attempts I made at it. You can still see butterflies
                    in some of them (e.g. Figure 15), and they're definitely noticeable in my GoPro
                    footage.

                    King's Peak doesn't waste any time presenting its flavor of challenge to you.
                    The flavor is one of scrambling up a steep, rocky slope on the left side that
                    abruptly ends at the ridge as a sheer cliff on the right side. It's like this
                    all the way from Anderson Pass up to the mountain's summit. And to be fair,
                    it's not that long of a climb once you're there. The timestamps on my photos
                    show that the process of going Anderson Pass -> Summit -> Anderson Pass only
                    took us about an hour and a half, and that was with a lot of chill time at the
                    summit!

                    Shortly after beginning the climb, you come to a short little flat section that
                    puts things into perspective. That's when you realize just how steep and high
                    the cliff on the right side is. Luckily for us acrophobes, you can keep your
                    distance from the cliff and just climb along the left side, but honestly even
                    that will expose you to some unnerving angles. It's fun, though!

                    There's a couloir that connects Anderson Pass directly to the first valley
                    we hiked across, on day one and the morning of day two. Looking up at it in
                    the morning, it didn't look like a reasonable route of ascent at all. But, we
                    overheard a couple of climbers saying that on a previous trip they had
                    descended via the couloir and saved several hours. Seems compelling, given
                    you could eliminate the east valley from the trip back. But, I'm sure it's
                    sketchy to descend. When looking back at the couloir, we also noticed that we
                    could see Dollar Lake way off in the distance.

                    At the summit, it was hard not to nap. The views are great, the cliff is still
                    right there next to you, and the physical drain from hiking almost 15 miles
                    uphill starts to set in. To me, what stood for several years as a seemingly
                    unrealistic challenge now felt like a cakewalk. On the other side of having
                    climbed this mountain, it doesn't even seem much more difficult than others
                    I've done. It's the same routine, just with an extra day of hiking on each end.
                    And hiking is just walking.

                    I think we chose the right days to climb, since we had perfect weather and the
                    trail wasn't crowded. On the way down on day three, we passed several groups of
                    more than 40 people each climbing up together, making it look like the ridge
                    and summit would likely be crowded the next day. At one point, a huge group
                    passed us and was followed a minute later by an individual guy leading a pack
                    of five white llamas tied together and each carrying several packs. We figured
                    that guy and the llamas were hauling supplies for the group.
