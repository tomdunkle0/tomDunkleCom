                    Ohio's Campbell Hill has a rich military history, as it used to be an air
                    defense station. Nowadays it's not only open to the public, but also a
                    community college. One of the more interesting features is a rotating
                    satellite dish. It seems very technical, but alas there are people that
                    don't want you to climb it. Signs warn that you're on camera, and there's
                    an array of bricks in the ground honoring people that the monument claims
                    to be war veterans. However, I suspect that the bricks truly represent folks
                    who've died climbing on the rotating satellite dish. I have a talent for
                    reading between the lines.

                    I visited this place during a rainy pre-Thanksgiving weekend in 2020. While
                    driving from Austin, Texas to visit my parents in Blairsville, Georgia,
                    I took a detour north and met up with Ry so that we could visit the Ohio
                    and Indiana state high points.

                    In the game of high-pointing, you just have to attack them when you can.
                    It was a cold and dreary weekend, but it was fun. Before visiting Campbell
                    Hill, we spent the night camping on Kiser Lake. Ry & I were the only two
                    people there, which honestly surprised me because I figured more people would
                    be in the boat we were in--travelling for the holidays but trying to be
                    ultra-cautious about social distancing and not carrying disease.

                    Kiser Lake is a nice campground, even if we didn't get to experience it in
                    the best conditions. There's a large number of sites and the lake is serene.
                    I showed up and started setting up camp around 8pm, and Ry arrived a couple
                    of hours later as he was driving from Connecticut to Colorado. Initially
                    there was a cat that was fishing in the lake, and it started to creep around
                    the site while I was setting up. But, the cat disappeared after a little while.
