The test code was slightly modified (but not functionally), to make this refactor possible.
-
- 5/29/23: Development
-- Submitted a change that adds the bulk of the remaining JavaScript code needed to show Virginia and North Carolina as high-pointed by default, and add 2023 to the year slider. This change encompasses all of the following:
--- In constants.js: Updated kNorthCarolina and kVirginia to use the prefix kPrefixGreenState instead of kPrefixRedState. Defined kVirginiaCheckMark. Added all new constants to the list of constants exported for use in test code.
--- In getMapContent.js: Adds the '2023' year string and updates the values of the year slider's attributes to reflect the new year.
--- In mapFunctions.js: Added a case for kVirginiaCheckMark to getStateIdForMousedOverPolygon() that directs to kVirginia.
--- In onClickMap_validInputs.test.js: Adds cases for Virginia and North Carolina to the test matrix confirming that clicking polylines which are green by default leads to the expected page. Conversely, the change removes the cases for Virginia and North Carolina from the test matrix validating that clicking on polylines that are red by default causes no action to be performed. Added a test case confirming that clicking on the Virginia check mark leads to Virginia.html. The change also imports kVirginiaCheckMark, kStateNameVirginia, and kStateNameNorthCarolina.
--- In onPageLoad.test.js: Updates the values of the constants kExpectedNumberOfCheckMarks, kExpectedNumberOfGreenPolylines, and kExpectedNumberOfRedPolylines to reflect that Virginia and North Carolina have now been high-pointed.
--- In updateAndGetCurrentBlueState_validInputs.test.js: Moves several array values involving Virginia and North Carolina from casesForMovingFromANormallyRedStateToAnotherState to casesForMovingFromANormallyGreenStateToAnotherState. Moves kVirginia and kNorthCarolina from normallyRedBorderStates to normallyGreenBorderStates. Moves several cases involving Virginia and North Carolina from casesForMovingFromANormallyRedStateToACheckMarkOrBox to casesForMovingFromANormallyGreenStateToACheckMarkOrBox. Removes one case from mostCasesForMovingBetweenACheckBoxAndAState, and adds one case to mostCasesForMovingBetweenACheckMarkAndAState. Adds an import for kVirginiaCheckMark. Removes two test cases which can't pass anymore now that all three of the following are true: VA/NC's check boxes are invisible by default, I've high-pointed them both, and the check boxes point to their own states in getStateIdForMousedOverPolygon(). It's not possible to click on an invisible element anyway, so any tests that fit all three of these criteria are likely not providing value.
-- Submitted a change to mapFunctions.js that adds Virginia and North Carolina to g_LoadedGreenStates, so that those two states now change color when the year slider's value is changed. This change also adds a lot of new test cases involving Virginia and North Carolina to onChangeValueOfSliderThumb.test.js.

-- Submitted a change that updates the project's dev_notes.pdf, and the publish date in the top-level index.html.
--- At this point, there are 3 TODOs in production code (all in the HTML) and 13 TODOs in test code. The entire tomDunkleCom project has 2,690 automated tests.
-
- 2/10/23: Development
-- Submitted a change to onMouseCrossingBorder.test.js that replaces the suite's only test case (which was a dummy placeholder) with a new automated test validating that calling onMouseCrossingBorder() updates mapContainer.mostRecentBlueStateId as expected.
-- Submitted a change to onClickMap_validInputs.test.js that removes a no-longer-needed import statement for the constant kUnpopulated.
-
- 2/7/23: Development
-- Submitted a change to the test description strings in onClickMap_invalidInputs.test.js and updateAndGetCurrentBlueState_invalidInputs.test.js, so that the strings match the format of those in isFilledLightBlue_invalidInputs.test.js. This was done to both shorten the names of the tests, and to alphabetize the tests in onClickMap_invalidInputs.test.js, so that the simplest test matrix (logically) comes first in the file.
-- Submitted a change to the test description string of the only test matrix in isFilledLightBlue_invalidInputs.test.js, so that the string better matches the format used in onClickMap_invalidInputs.test.js and updateAndGetCurrentBlueState_invalidInputs.test.js.
-
- 2/6/23: Development
-- Submitted a change to isFilledLightBlue_invalidInputs.test.js that replaces the suite's three separate test cases (null, undefined, and empty string) with one new test matrix handling all three cases using kUnpopulatedInputs.
-
- 2/2/23: Development
-- Submitted a change that makes all automated test suites that use 'each' import it in a separate section titled "Jest includes", rather than in the "Constant includes" section, since each isn't actually being imported from constants.js.
-
- 2/1/23: Development
-- Submitted a change that renames setMarginsOfYearSliderToHalfOfSlideContainerHeight() to setYearSliderMarginsToHalfOfSlideContainerHeight() throughout the project.
-- Submitted a change that names the automated test suite onClickMap.test.js to onClickMap_validInputs.test.js.
-
- 1/29/23: Development
-- Submitted a change to onClickMap_invalidInputs.test.js that defines a new automated test matrix validating that calling onClickMap() with a clickEvent input whose target has an unpopulated id attribute returns a null value. This change also removes a duplicate test case from onClickMap.test.js.
-- Submitted a change to onClickMap.test.js that removes a TODO comment which is no longer needed now that all tests which don't require onPageLoad() have been moved to onClickMap_invalidInputs.test.js.
-
- 1/28/23: Development
-- Submitted a change that defines an automated test suite called onClickMap_invalidInputs.test.js, containing one new automated test matrix validating that calling onClickMap() with an unpopulated clickEvent input returns null. This change also removes a test definition for the null input case from onClickMap.test.js, and updates one other test matrix in that suite to use the test constant kUnpopulatedInputs in its case definition.
-- Submitted a change to onClickMap_invalidInputs.test.js that defines a new automated test matrix validating that calling onClickMap() with a clickEvent input whose target attribute is unpopulated returns a null value. This change also removes a duplicate test case from onClickMap.test.js.
-
- 1/25/23: Development
-- Submitted a change that separates the automated test matrix defined in the previous change from updateAndGetCurrentBlueState.test.js into a new automated test suite called updateAndGetCurrentBlueState_invalidInputs.test.js. I decided it's worthwhile to not load the page when running tests that don't require the page to be loaded in order to pass (which are, in reality, the unit tests of this project, even if they aren't labelled as such yet).
-
- 1/24/23: Development
-- Submitted a change to updateAndGetCurrentBlueState.test.js that defines an automated test matrix confirming that calling the function with an unpopulated mouseEvent input returns null. This change also removes a (now) redundant test case calling the function with a null input, as well as a TODO comment suggesting that some tests don't need the initial calls to onPageLoad(). The TODO comment was removed with the intent of not running tests that don't load the page, but the decision was reversed in the next change.

- 1/22/23: Development
-- Submitted a change that separates the only automated test of onOrientationChange() from high_points.test.js into a new test suite called onOrientationChange.test.js.
-- Submitted a change that separates three automated tests validating conditions when the page first loads from high_points.test.js into a new test suite called onPageLoad.test.js.
-- Submitted a change that separates the only automated test of onMouseCrossingBorder() from high_points.test.js into a new test suite called onMouseCrossingBorder.test.js. At this point, the only tests remaining in high_points.test.js were of resetStateFillColorToDefault(), so this change also renames high_points.test.js to resetStateFillColorToDefault.test.js.

-- Submitted a change to testFunctions.js that removes a stale (i.e. no longer used) import statement for kStyle.
-- Submitted a change to updateCheckMarkAndBoxToMatchStateFillColor.test.js that removes unneeded white space from the very first line of code in the file.
-
- 1/15/23: Development
-- Submitted a change to setMarginsOfYearSliderToHalfOfSlideContainerHeight.test.js that removes the expect statement confirming kMargin is populated from beforeAll(), and adds a comment to beforeAll() clarifying why it's still necessary to confirm that kUnitNamePixels is populated before running tests.
-
- 1/11/23: Development
-- Submitted a change that refactors setMarginsOfYearSliderToHalfOfSlideContainerHeight.test.js by making the helper method mockSlideContainerHeight() return the year slider instead of letting the test methods each get the year slider separately.

-- Submitted a change to matchLightBlueFillForTwoPolylines.test.js that removes four redundant expect statements.
-
- 1/9/23: Development

-- Submitted a change to updateCheckMarkAndBoxToMatchStateFillColor.test.js that removes a few stale (i.e. no longer used) import statements.
-- Submitted a change that renames kInvalidStringInputs in testConstants to kUnpopulatedInputs. This change also updates the names of a few test cases, and replaces the constant invalidBooleanInputs in updateCheckMarkAndBoxToMatchStateFillColor.test.js with kUnpopulatedInputs, thereby defining one new automated test case.
-
- 12/15/22: Development
-- Submitted a change to setMarginsOfYearSliderToHalfOfSlideContainerHeight.test.js that renames every constant and variable named 'slider' throughout the suite to 'yearSlider'.
-- Submitted a change that moves the definition of kInvalidStringInputs from updateCheckMarkAndBoxToMatchStateFillColor.test.js to testConstants, and updates both that test suite and setMarginsOfYearSliderToHalfOfSlideContainerHeight.test.js to import the constant from testConstants.
-
- 12/13/22: Development
-- Submitted a change to setMarginsOfYearSliderToHalfOfSlideContainerHeight.test.js that fixes a magic number.

-
- 12/12/22: Development
-- Submitted a change to setMarginsOfYearSliderToHalfOfSlideContainerHeight.test.js that defines beforeAll() to ensure that kMargin and kUnitNamePixels are populated, rather than letting each test do this in its own setup block.
-
- 12/11/22: Development

-
- 12/9/22: Development
-- Submitted a change to setMarginsOfYearSliderToHalfOfSlideContainerHeight.test.js that fixes a magic string.
-
- 12/6/22: Development
-- Submitted a change to setMarginsOfYearSliderToHalfOfSlideContainerHeight.test.js that removes a pre-existing TODO comment suggesting removing the suite's beforeEach() definition after exploring the idea and finding that it can't be done without removing the tests' pre-assertions (therefore negatively impacting test coverage).
-
- 12/5/22: Development
-- Submitted a change to setMarginsOfYearSliderToHalfOfSlideContainerHeight.test.js that fixes a couple of magic strings.
-
- 12/2/22: Development
-- Submitted a change to updateCheckMarkAndBoxToMatchStateFillColor.test.js that makes the suite's tests use kArbitraryPolylineId (imported from testConstants) rather than a kArbitraryStateId which was declared within the suite.

-
- 12/1/22: Development
-- Submitted a change to updateCheckMarkAndBoxToMatchStateFillColor.test.js that expands a test case for passing null for highPointedWithinSliderRange into a matrix that also tests an undefined value.
-
- 11/29/22: Development
-- Submitted a change to updateCheckMarkAndBoxToMatchStateFillColor.test.js that defines two new automated test matrices confirming that the check box and mark of Michigan update properly when either of Michigan's two polylines are passed to updateCheckMarkAndBoxToMatchStateFillColor().
-
- 11/25/22: Development
-- Submitted a change to updateCheckMarkAndBoxToMatchStateFillColor() that adjusts the function's logic to not use the constant kMichigan. Since this function was the only place that kMichigan was used (everywhere else uses kMichiganMainland and kMichiganPeninsula), this change also removes kMichigan from production code entirely, and removes import statements for the constant from several test classes where it wasn't even being used.
-- Submitted a change to updateCheckMarkAndBoxToMatchStateFillColor.test.js that fixes a magic string, which was coincidentally incorrect anyway.
-- Submitted a change to updateCheckMarkAndBoxToMatchStateFillColor.test.js that fixes another magic string.
-
- 11/23/22: Development
-- Submitted a change that defines a new test suite called setMarginsOfYearSliderToHalfOfSlideContainerHeight.test.js. This change moves all tests of setMarginsOfYearSliderToHalfOfSlideContainerHeight() into the new suite from high_points.test.js, and this change also removes many stale (i.e. no longer used) import statements from high_points.test.js.
-
- 11/22/22: Development

-- Submitted a change that updates the project's dev_notes.pdf, and the publish date in the top-level index.html.
--- At this point, there are 3 TODOs in production code (all in the HTML) and 21 TODOs in test code. The entire tomDunkleCom project has 2,671 automated tests.
--- *Note:* After publishing this update to www.tomdunkle.com, I manually edited Missouri.html in siteground's online editor to fix a couple of content mistakes. I left the site up like that for the duration of development on the next feature (a round of test refactoring), which included a permanent fix for the content.
-

-
- 11/14/22: Development
-- Submitted a change that adds rough drafts of Missouri.html and Iowa.html, plus removes a few photos from the 'mo' images folder that I deemed uninteresting.
-- Submitted a change that removes a commented-out test case from onClickMap.test.js which was invalidated by this feature (adding Missouri and Iowa), and is no longer needed since it's been replaced by several new test cases.
-- Submitted a change that removes a no-longer-needed TODO comment from testFunctions.js about a rename that I decided not to do, as the new name would be too long.
-
- 11/11/22: Development
-- Submitted a change that replaces a couple of remaining calls to expectTestConstantIsPopulated() in high_points.test.js and tomHasHighPointedStateWithinSliderRange.test.js with calls to changeValueOfSliderThumb(), and stops exporting the former from testConstants.js.
-- Submitted a change that single-sources all year slider value constants in testConstants.js.
-- Submitted a change that eliminates a magic string in moveSliderToBeforeStateWasHighPointed().
-- Submitted a change that eliminates a magic number in moveSliderToBeforeStateWasHighPointed().

-
testFunctions.js.
- 11/6/22: Development
-- Submitted a change that defines expectTestConstantIsPopulated() in tomHasHighPointedStateWithinSliderRange.test.js, after I realized that tests can exhibit false passes if year slider value constants are not properly exported from testConstants.js.
-
- 11/5/22: Development
-- Submitted a change that defines a new automated test matrix in onClickMap.test.js, validating that the action of clicking on check boxes that normally handle click events (via getStateIdForMousedOverPolygon()) after moving the year slider to before those states were high-pointed produces no result.
-- Submitted a change that removes several stale (i.e. no longer defined) constants from the import statements in mapFunctions.js.
-
- 11/3/22: Development
-- Submitted a change that defines a new automated test matrix in updateAndGetCurrentBlueState.test.js, validating that certain mouse movements from check boxes to states produce the expected results after the year slider's position has been moved back to before the respective states were high-pointed. This change also partially addresses the need to update a temporarily commented-out set of test cases due to Iowa being green now instead of red.
-- Submitted a change that defines automated test cases in updateAndGetCurrentBlueState.test.js simulating mouse movements from the Iowa check box to Minnesota, as well as a few similar cases for other states.
-
- 11/2/22: Development
-- Submitted a change that fixes two temporarily commented-out test cases, which previously expected clicking on rIowa and rMissouri not to lead anywhere, so that the test cases now expect navigating to Iowa.html and Missouri.html, respectively. This change also defines two new automated test cases asserting that clicking on cIowa and cMissouri leads to the respective pages.
-
- 11/1/22: Development
-- Submitted a change that adds a case for the Missouri check mark to getStateIdForClickedPolygon(), so that the user can access Missouri.html (still non-existent) by clicking on Missouri's check mark.
-- Submitted a change that adds a case for the Iowa check mark to getStateIdForMousedOverPolygon(), so that the user can access Iowa.html (still non-existent) by clicking on Iowa's check mark, and mousing over the check mark from within Minnesota makes Iowa turn light blue.
-
- 10/31/22: Development
-- Submitted a change that removes duplicate photos from the 'ia' folder, and gives all of the usable photos human-readable file names.
-- Submitted a change that removes duplicate photos from the 'mo' folder, and gives all of the usable photos human-readable file names.
-
- 10/28/22: Development
-- Submitted a change that adds gIowa and gMissouri to g_LoadedGreenStates in mapFunctions.js, thereby making those states update in response to the year slider.
-
- 10/27/22: Development
-- Submitted a change that defines cIowa (the Iowa check mark) and cMissouri (the Missouri check mark) in getMapContent.js, and changes visibility attributes such that those are displayed by default instead of the respective check boxes.
-- Submitted a change that updates the prefixes of the Iowa and Missouri state polyline elements from "r" to "g" in both html (getMapContent.js) and JavaScript (constants.js, testConstants.js).
-
- 10/23/22: Development
-- Submitted a change that updates the default value of rIowa and rMissouri's fill attributes from red to green.

-
*** BEGIN WORK ON ADDING MISSOURI AND IOWA ***
*** END WORK ON TEST REFACTORING (while in Oaxaca). ***
- 10/5/22: Development
-- Submitted a change to updateCheckMarkAndBoxToMatchStateFillColor.test.js that reverts to using the 'arbitrary' terminology to refer to the Connecticut polyline, check mark, and box, but does so by defining constants that clearly show that the arbitrarily-chosen objects all necessarily correspond to the same state.
--- At this point, there are 3 TODOs in production code (all in the HTML) and 22 TODOs in test code. The entire tomDunkleCom project has 2,323 automated tests.
-
- 9/28/22: Development
-- Submitted a change to updateCheckMarkAndBoxToMatchStateFillColor.test.js that renames kHasBeenHighPointed to kHighPointedWithinSliderRange, plus renames a local constant called hasNotBeenHighPointed to notHighPointedWithinSliderRange.
-
- 9/27/22: Development
-- Submitted a change to two tests in updateCheckMarkAndBoxToMatchStateFillColor.test.js to use the constant kConnecticut instead of kArbitraryStateId, since the state ID is not actually arbitrary (the state passed to the function call must be the same state whose check mark and box are under test). This change also fixes a magic boolean in one of the two tests.

-- Submitted a change that defines the constant kUtahCheckMark, adds a case for it in getStateIdForMousedOverPolygon(), and accordingly updates a few automated tests simulating the mouse moving from Utah's check mark to Wyoming.
-- Submitted a change that fixes the organization of a few test cases in updateAndGetCurrentBlueState.test.js, and adds a few new test cases.
-- Submitted a change that removes a commented-out test case which can't pass anymore now that all three of the following are true: Utah's check box is invisible by default, I've high-pointed Utah, and Utah's check box points to Utah in getStateIdForMousedOverPolygon(). It's not possible to click on an invisible element anyway, so any tests that fit all three of these criteria are likely not providing value.
-
- 8/3/22: Development
-- Submitted a change that adds a simple placeholder Utah.html, so that clicking on Utah doesn't return a 'page not found' error.
-- Submitted a change to the test in onClickMap.test.js that expects clicking Utah to return a null value, so that the test instead expects a valid URL for Utah.html to be returned.
-- Submitted a change that updates several automated tests in updateAndGetCurrentBlueState.test.js to expect Utah to normally be green instead of red.
-- Submitted a change that re-enables several test cases in updateAndGetCurrentBlueState.test.js that had been temporarily disabled while the JavaScript and HTML code were using different state ID prefixes for Utah.

-- Submitted a change that updates Utah's id prefix from "r" to "g", and defines the pointer property on Utah. This change disables several automated tests which need to be updated in the future to account for Utah being green instead of red.
--- *Question: how many automated tests were there in the project both before and after these updates to the high points? Also, how about with the discography updates?*
-- Submitted a change that updates the default value of Utah's fill attribute to green instead of red.
-- Submitted a change to the definition of the constant kUtah, so that the constant uses the green state prefix instead of the red state prefix.
-- Submitted a change that makes Utah's color update in response to slider motions, and makes the state clickable even though there still isn't an .html page for it.
-
- 8/1/22: Development

- 10/25/21: Development
-- Submitted a change that just updates the publish date on the top-level index.html of the website.
--- *Observation:* I pushed the code live to my website in this state. The next day, I observed that my latest fix does indeed seem to drastically improve how the high points page handles screen orientation changes, but it's still not quite working 100% of the time. I had to play with it quite a bit to get it to fail, but it seems like my app is handling ~95% of orientation changes now, as opposed to ~50% that it was in the previous state.
--- *Goal:* Keep the code in this state, and clean it up--get it back down to 0 TODOs in production and <= 27 TODOs in test code.

-- Submitted a change that defines kPeninsula in constants.js, and changes the polyline "MichiganUpperPeninsula" to "MichiganPeninsula".
-- Submitted a change that adds a font-family = Impact assignment to each year string.
-- Submitted a change that successfully maximizes the viewing space that the map container fills. This change reassigns the height of the year-string, slide-container, and flex-row CSS classes to a hardcoded 30px, but then it adds logic to onPageLoad() that resizes the map container based on those values.
-- Submitted a change that slightly refactors the logic added to onPageLoad() in the previous change, plus a couple of comments.

-- Submitted a change that copies the flex-row CSS class into another class called year-string, then updates flex-row's height from 30px to 5%. This change eliminates wasted vertical space between the three top-level UI elements (the map container, the slider, and the row of year strings).
-- Submitted a change that removes no-longer-needed width assignment statements on the year string paragraphs, plus redefines the year-string CSS class's height and width to both 100%.

-
- 9/1/21: Development

-
- 8/31/21: Development
-- Submitted a change that adds an automated test case mocking the slide container's scrollHeight property and confirming that loading the page sets the slider's margin to half the height. This change also separates the logic to do so from onPageLoad() and into a separate function called setTopAndBottomMarginsOfYearSlider().
-- Submitted a change that removes the no-longer-needed return value from setTopAndBottomMarginsOfYearSlider().
-- Submitted a change that adds a couple of automated tests for resetStateFillColorToDefault(), confirming that both of Michigan's parts are reset to red after mousing out of it if the year slider is first set to a year before I high-pointed Michigan.
-- Submitted a change that makes the year slider a global object which is defined on page load in map.js, so that we don't need to keep getting it hundreds of times per minute while people interact with the page.
-- Submitted a change that removes a stale comment from the last change--I learned that the global variables in map.js don't *technically* need their own assignment statements at the head of the file, since assigning to something that doesn't exist creates a global property. But, I removed the comment and just left the assignment statements as-is for readability.
-- Submitted a change that slightly refactors setTopAndBottomMarginsOfYearSlider() by renaming a constant to make one magic number less ambiguous.

-
- 8/28/21: Development
-- Submitted a change that partially refactors onYearSliderChange() in order to remove some magic strings.
-- Submitted a change that defines kCursorAttributeValueAuto and kCursorAttributeValuePointer in constants.js, plus exports the definition of the latter so that the value can be used in test code instead of the separate constant that was previously defined in high_points.test.js.
-- Submitted a change that partially refactors onYearSliderChange() in order to remove the potentially confusing hardcoded string, "gMichigan".
-- Submitted a change that makes the beforeAll() routine in high_points.test.js call onPageLoad() instead of just setting the body's inner HTML. This change also updates the TODO comment above beforeAll().

-- Submitted a change that removes a TODO comment from map.js, which had already been taken care of with yesterday's first change.
-- Submitted a change that makes onYearSliderChange() update the cursor property values of states whenever they change between green and red in response to the slider control changing.
-- Submitted a change that defines a constant kYearSliderId for the year slider's ID.
-- Submitted a change that adds an unpopulated check to the yearId parameter of tomHasHighPointedByNow().
-
- 8/22/21: Development
-- Submitted a change that fills out the test matrix for tomHasHighPointedByNow() with cases for the slider occupying each value less than the maximum.
-- Submitted a change that defines the strings "0" through "7" as constants for the value of the year slider.
-
- 8/21/21: Development
-- Submitted a change that removes the function tomHasHighPointed(), and replaces its one remaining use with a call to tomHasHighPointedByNow(). This update also repurposes a test matrix for the former function to use the latter instead.
-- Submitted a change that combines two separate unpopulated checks at the beginning of tomHasHighPointedByNow() into one compound unpopulated check.
-- Submitted a change that removes the CSS definition hiding the ability to highlight the year slider with the keyboard, since I actually do want people to be able to focus on the slider with the keyboard if they want to.
-- Submitted a change that removes the unneeded "width: 100%" definition from the slider, since the width is already defined by the slide-container.
-- Submitted a change that replaces several magic strings with constants in onYearSliderChange().
-
- 8/20/21: Development
-- Submitted a change that adds a check box for every state that's already been high-pointed, and implements the mechanism of replacing the check marks with check boxes when moving the slider back to years before the state was high-pointed.
-- Submitted a change that makes resetStateFillColorToDefault() implement Michigan's special logic when the slider is set to a year before I high-pointed Michigan.
-- Submitted a change that updates the slider color from blue to green, although I did this by copying and pasting a huge amount of CSS that I probably don't need in the long run.
-- Submitted a change that refactors isCheckMarkOrBox(), and adds one test case to its matrix for the input "bConnecticut".
-- Submitted a change that renames kPrefixCheckIcon to kPrefixCheckMark.
-
- 8/19/21: Development
-- Submitted a change that moves the array of loaded green polylines out of onYearSliderChange() and into a global variable called g_LoadedGreenStates.

-- Submitted a change that removes a TODO comment for a bug which I retroactively realized was also fixed by the previous change.
-- Submitted a change that adds a value=0 case to the year slider, for pre-2015 when I had not high-pointed any states. This change also significantly helps the alignment (at least when viewed on my Desktop PC right now) of the year strings with the slider values.
-- Submitted a change to various heights in an attempt to create a more uniform appearance across devices; mapContainer height -> 100%, svg height -> 90%, year strings now have a 5% height on their divs instead of themselves, and the height on the slide container is now 5%.
-
- 8/17/21: Development
-- Submitted a change that fills out the whole chronology, year-by-year, in terms of which states' fill colors change in response to which slider values.

-- Submitted a change that aligns the year strings somewhat more closely with the slider, although the alignment is still not perfect.
-- Submitted a change that reduces the height of the flex-row containing the year strings.
-- Submitted a change that puts each year string inside a flex-row, plus reduces the granularity of the slider control from 1-100 to 1-7 (one for each year).
-- Submitted a change that makes California's fill color toggle between green and red for slider values 7 and 6, respectively.
-

-- Submitted a change with some minor stylistic updates. I used siteground's web File Manager to upload each state's .html file, plus high_points.html and map.js, to www.tomdunkle.com.
-- Submitted a bug fix where clicking on Michigan in the online version of the module (which isn't exposed yet) wasn't working because the code pointed to michigan.html (lower case) rather than Michigan.html (upper case).
-- Submitted a bug fix where the images for New Hampshire were not showing properly in the online version of the module, because the images all had file extension ".JPG" (upper case) instead of ".jpg" (lower case). I used the Windows REN (rename) command to accomplish this.
-- Submitted and uploaded a change that adds a small revision note in the corner of the website's front page.
-
- 2/26/21: Development
-- Submitted a change that implements the concept of polyline ID prefixes.
-- Submitted another change with minor refactoring over the above change.

-
- 2/25/21: Development
-- Submitted a change that finally removes the last of the layering architecture from high_points.html that was originally used for the crosshairs. The crosshairs feature is now totally removed from the project.
-- Submitted a change that reduced the last X point in each check mark by 0.3, making all the check marks appear at a slightly tighter angle. I did this to fix quirky behavior around the Delaware check mark slightly overlapping with Pennsylvania.
-- Submitted a bug fix for an issue where one of the minor Alaskan islands would highlight when moused over, which was unintentional. This edit introduced the function isInsignificantPolygon().
-- Submitted a bug fix for an issue where mousing into the map through one of the northern check marks that extends the border (Minnesota, Michigan, New York, Vermont) would not cause that state to light up.
-- Submitted a change that addressed a comment I left in the code a while ago, about making sure to thoroughly handle the cases where getStateIdForClickedPolygon() and getStateIdForMousedOverPolygon() return kUnpopulated (an empty string).
-
- 2/24/21: Development
-- Submitted a change that adds mouse-over redirection for the red check boxes that are close enough to state borders for it to be an issue.
-- Submitted a change that adds support for click-thru on check marks.
--- At this point, all of the intended functionality exists in the project, and all of the remaining work is clean-up and refactoring.
-
- 2/23/21: Development
-- Submitted a change that adds redirecting to various check marks for mouse hover events, i.e. different states will highlight now if they overlap with other states' check marks in inconvenient ways.
-
- 2/21/21: Development
-- Submitted a change that makes the view_box element always invisible in .html, and removes the crosshairs although leaves some of their infrastructure in place.
-- Submitted two more changes that are both very small refactoring changes to high_points.html, towards the goal of removing the crosshairs' no-longer-needed layering architecture.

-- Submitted a change that adds the red check boxes to the map.
-- Submitted a change fixing a bug: refreshing the map page while moused over a check or box would make that item retain a red fill when you moused off of it. This was the case where g_MostRecentBlueState == kUnpopulated, so I moved that check to a more outer position in the logic of updateStateFillColors().
-- Submitted one more change with some refactoring of updateStateFillColors().
-
- 2/19/21: Development
-- Submitted a change fixing a bug in which a single check mark would color itself red if you refreshed the page while moused over a state, then moved over its check. This was a null-checking issue in updateStateFillColors().
-- Submitted a change that adds a green check mark at the high point of every one of the 31 states I've completed on the map.
-
- 2/18/21: Development
-- Submitted a change that adds a proof-of-concept of the green check mark on Illinois, albeit at the wrong location.
-
- 2/15/21: Development
-- Submitted a change that finally completes the first draft of prose for every state except for Kentucky, which is still a dead link. As of this change, there are no longer any placeholder paragraphs in the project.
-
- 2/14/21: Development
-- Submitted a change that adds a first draft of prose for every state in the mid-Atlantic and Great Lakes regions, except for one placeholder paragraph in New York.
-- Submitted a change that adds a first draft of prose for every state in the Mountain region, except for one placeholder paragraph in Colorado.
-- Submitted a change that adds a first draft of prose for every state in the Southeastern region except for South Carolina. This update also completes the prose in New York.
-
- 2/11/21: Development
-- Submitted a change that adds a first draft of prose for every state in the New England region.
-
- 2/9/21: Development
-- Submitted a change that adds a 'Figure' caption to every single photo in every single .html page in the project.
--- Uploaded this change to my Google Drive.
-
- 2/4/21: Development
-- Submitted a change that adds a deliberate color scheme for each of the 30 .html pages (not yet including Kentucky).
-
- 2/2/21: Development
-- Submitted a change that adds the basic stats of each high point to each .html page.
--- Change also includes some basic color scheme and prose work, but just bits and pieces.
-
- 1/29/21: Development
-- Submitted a change that refactors a ton of code in map.js.
-
- 1/28/21: Development
-- Submitted a change that adds support for four more states, leaving Kentucky as the only unsupported green state. I copied this backup to my Google Drive, removing the previous backups of this project to make space for it.
-
- 1/26/21: Development
-- Submitted a change that adds .html pages for several more high points I've done, leaving only five states left to implement.
-
- 1/23/21: Development
-- Submitted a change that adds .html pages for many, but not all of the high points I've done.
-
- 1/19/21: Development
-- Submitted a change that adds a click-through from Colorado to a new colorado.html that I've defined, which is in a partially finished state.
-
- 1/18/21: Development
-- Submitted a change that updates the conflict resolution from the previous change to use the fromElement and toElement properties of a mouse event, thereby fixing the inaccuracy problem and allowing for easy conflict resolution between almost any state. This change also included some refactoring.
-- Submitted a change that sets the 50 states to default to either a green or red fill when not moused over, and a blue fill when moused over. Now, the states that I've highpointed so far have been accurately captured.

Submitted a change that adds a first draft of my (very messy) attempt to resolve a conflict between Texas and Louisiana. It didn't work, though, as it was super inaccurate and picked Louisiana every time.
-
- 1/13/21: Development
-- Submitted a change that adds full click-and-fill support for all 50 states. Finally uploaded the very first backup of this project to my Google Drive.
-- Submitted a change that updates the logic to fill a state on mouse hover instead of a click.
-
- 1/12/21: Development
-- Refactored the code from the previous edit.
-
- 1/10/21: Development
-- I set the preserveAspectRatio property on both SVGs to "none" to stop 'fixing' the scale of the image, which corrected the inaccuracies of the crosshair. I also did some refactoring.
-- I made an update that sets the fill on Louisiana's polyline to green when you click it, and transparent when you click anywhere else.
-- It turned out that, later in the list of polylines in the USA .svg, a ton of states are just one polyline each for the whole state. This allowed my to generalize the previous edit in a way that I'm now supporting filling 28 of the 50 states with green in response to a click. The code isn't clean at time of this writing, though, and I have some refactoring to do.

- 1/8/21: Development
-- I created a mechanism where I encircle Louisiana with a red outline whenever you click the screen. This is to verify the max/min x/y coordinates my algorithm gets. I also added a green crosshair that gets drawn onscreen wherever click, however the x coordinate is inaccurate and I need to clean up my math.
-
- 1/7/21: Development
-- I made an edit that pops up a message whenever the user clicks on the USA map. This required changing the svg from being represented by an <object> to being represented by a <svg> with a nested <script> and <img>.
-- Next, I updated the JavaScript function to get an individual polyline element from inside the svg.
-- Created map.js.

- 1/5/21-1/6/21: Development
-- The first small step I took in updating www.tomdunkle.com was to create an index.html that is identical to deersim.html, except that the 'Release Notes' link points to deersim.html instead of ReleaseNotes.txt. It works!
-- Next, I removed all unneeded code from index.html, leaving the phony "Release Notes" link intact.
-- Next, I replaced the phony "Release Notes" link with two, more clear links: one for I-84  Simulator and one for a placeholder that will be my mountain photoblog.
-- Next, I downloaded a public domain .svg vector of the USA from publicdomainvectors.org and put it on high_points.html.
-- Next, I started learning flexbox (CSS) and I defined a flex-container that allows me to show three numbers centered in a column, perfectly.
--- At this point, I saved a backup locally but I am not uploading it to Google Drive yet because these backups are going to be large due to the audio files.
-- Next, I replaced the three numbers with appropriately-spaced links to the different subpages. I saved another local backup like this.
-- Next, I cleaned up high_points.html to center the USA map and make it the only thing visible on the view.
