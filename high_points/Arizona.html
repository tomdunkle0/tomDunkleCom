                    At the time that I completed Humphreys Peak, I did not consider it the most
                    difficult high point I'd gotten to yet (New Mexico, Maine, and Colorado were
                    all more difficult overall). But, due to the circumstances I considered the
                    very last portion of Humphreys to be the most difficult section I'd crossed
                    so far to get to a state high point. In some ways, I consider the summit of
                    Humphreys to be the moment in my life when I became a true mountaineer.

                    We took the Humphreys Peak Trail, with the trailhead starting at the
                    parking lot for the Arizona Snowbowl. The trail meets with Doyle
                    Saddle shortly before the summit of the mountain. Several
                    people along the trail had warned us of very strong winds and low temps
                    at the summit. As one man specifically claimed: "70mph winds and sub-zero
                    temperatures". There is debate among the group as to how true that claim is.
                    <br><br>
                    Just after taking a left to continue on the trail at the intersection, we
                    hiked along a gentle ridge, not finding the trail itself daunting, but as we
                    continued the harsh winds from the left steadily increased. Then, after
                    emerging from one final passage with a bit of leftward protection in the form
                    of boulders, it happened. Suddenly, we were being blasted with winds that felt
                    about twice as strong as before, and it became clear that standing upright was
                    going to be difficult if not impossible during the final stretch.

                    We straddled the side of the mountain, intentionally crawling around the side
                    that would keep us shielded from the wind. Clutching large boulders one at a
                    time, I sidled up to the summit. At the summit, a large rock wall had
                    previously been constructed to shield climbers from the wind. On the
                    unobstructed side was one of the most spectacular views I've ever taken in.
                    Perhaps I was delerious from having defeated the wind.
                    <br><br>
                    On my way back down the windy section, I was ballsy enough to just stand up
                    straight and run through the most exposed and windiest part. It felt like
                    running while submerged in water, and somehow I was able to do it. As soon
                    as we all got out of the windy part, we sat on a protected ledge and took
                    a breather while Aaron played music on his backpack speakers. We knew that
                    we were in the clear at that point.

                    At a couple of points along the trail, we saw the remains of avalanches.
                    One of the trail's switchbacks is right along an avalanche line, and Figures
                    7 and 8 demonstrate looking down and up from that switchback. Naturally,
                    I thought about how fun it would be to just climb up the avalanche line, but I
                    wasn't sure that it would go anywhere useful. The avalanche lines are similar
                    to the ones visible on Wheeler Peak in New Mexico.
                    <br><br>
                    Another cool feature was the snow spiral that was visible inside the bowl of
                    Humphreys Peak. Presumably the wind currents tend to a circular direction
                    because of the bowl which causes snow to drift into the spiral pattern.

                    Our campsite was also fantastic on this trip. It was in the Sunset Crater
                    Volcano National Monument. The first thing we did when we got there was get
                    my car struck in loose volcanic gravel, but the guys all jumped out and pushed
                    and they were able to help me get it out.
                    <br><br>
                    Then, we found this sweet secluded spot up on top of a hill, with a perfect
                    view of the mountain. There was also a tree that we hung our eating utensils
                    from. After we set up camp, we wandered around the area surveying our own holes
                    for a round of disc golf, and occasionally cheering at dirt bikers and ATVers
                    riding around the area.
