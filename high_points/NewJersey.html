                    New Jersey didn't get too creative with naming their state's high point,
                    High Point. The Appalachian Trail passes through High Point State Park,
                    though it doesn't cross the High Point itself. The park is mostly forested,
                    featuring various hiking trails, grotesque millipedes, and bright orange
                    lizards which I refer to as "Jersey Boys".

                    On top of the High Point is a large, towering monument 220 feet tall.
                    The monument sits on top of a square viewing platform. The monument's height
                    makes it visible all around the park, so it's difficult to get lost. The
                    Jersey Boys won't help you if you do.

                    This was my first post-pandemic high point. I'd driven from Austin, Texas
                    to my hometown of Danbury, Connecticut with a stop to camp in Louisiana,
                    a stop at my parents' house in Georgia, and a stop to camp in Virginia.
                    At the time, New York City was the danger zone for COVID-19, so even just
                    being on hiking trails in New Jersey felt risky.
