                    Sassafras Mountain's peak is right along the border between North and South
                    Carolina. It's possible to drive to the top, or you can hike from a variety
                    of distances. When I visited, I started at the Foothills Trail entrance A4.
                    The trail is moderately steep, and covers picturesque South Carolina
                    wilderness.

                    Various portions of the trail reminded me of the shape of the roads along
                    Iceland's fjords. The way that the trail weaves in and out of the mountainside
                    is similar in shape to how roads are cut along the latter country's coastlines.

                    From the summit of the mountain, I saw thick clouds of fog sitting in the
                    valleys between the foothills. This is a phenomenon I've seen in several
                    parts of Appalachia over the years. Now that I'm looking at the photos again,
                    I guess that I've never had the reverse experience of being in one of these
                    clouds of fog.

                    The summit has a large concrete viewing platform built on top of it. On top
                    of the platform is the marked border between the two Carolinas (see Figure
                    15 at the bottom of the page). Near the viewing platform is a series of paved
                    walkways leading down to the Foothills Trail, as well as a network of large
                    rocks that you can wander around.

                    The trail's pretty well maintained. I think there are many more miles of
                    trail in this area beyond what I touched on Sassafras, and I'm sure it's
                    a great place to spend time. I remember feeling constrained that I had
                    to take a flight back to Texas just a couple of days later, because I wanted
                    to do a longer camping trip in this area. I probably will sometime in the
                    future.

                    Towards the end of the hike, there were long shadows cast through the woods.
                    This is both because of the shape of the hills, and the angle of the sun due
                    to how late in the year it was (only three days after the winter equinox).
                    Despite being Christmas Eve, it was incredibly warm out and I was sweating.
                    I forget exactly but I think it was in the 60s F.
