                    Taum Sauk Mountain is an easy high point to bag, but it's not without its
                    rewards. When I left my house in Austin, Texas, to drive towards Taum Sauk
                    Mountain, I told myself that this trip (which was to check off Missouri and
                    Iowa), would likely be the last long road trip I'd do just to grab some easy US
                    high points. The planned "weekend" trip was, and I knew that it would be, an
                    absolute crunch. The driving distance was 2,663 miles, and I drove for a total
                    of 43 hours throughout a five day period. The same period also included two
                    full work days (from two different hotel rooms), both high points, and some
                    stops for barbecue and beer in St. Louis.

                    After picking up Ry and Victoria at the St. Louis airport, we made a quick
                    grocery run and then drove to the Taum Sauk Mountain Campground, which is a
                    maintained campground in Taum Sauk Mountain State Park. The campground is right
                    next to the high point itself, and I joked that this was probably the closest
                    to a high point that we'd ever camped. Although I was expecting generally cold
                    weather for the weekend, it was warm in Missouri--low 60s Fahrenheit, and since
                    I was coming from Texas, I was happy to be camping in a t-shirt all night at
                    that temperature. Since the weather was nice, the campground was almost full,
                    but we managed to claim one of the last sites when we arrived.

                    The summit of Taum Sauk Mountain is right next to the trailhead for the Mina
                    Sauk Falls trail, which is a three mile loop. We decided to check out the
                    summit first, and hike the trail afterwards. Unsurprisingly, the summit feels
                    more like a clearing in the woods than a mountain peak, but it's peaceful.
                    They've got all of the standard high point fare; a registry, a plaque in the
                    ground, a big rock for squat photos, and a bench that sadly doesn't bear the
                    familiar High Pointer's Foundation logo you find at other points' benches. It's
                    one of those... imposter benches...

                    After briefly admiring the state high point, we set off to hike the
                    three-mile-long Mina Sauk Falls trail. As it turns out, mid-October is a good
                    time for leaf-peeping in Missouri, and the last time I got to look at some good
                    leaves that aren't green was when I did the New York and Vermont high points in
                    October back in 2018. We had to compete, because the rules of leaf-peeping
                    clearly state that nobody else is allowed to peep your leaves after you peep
                    them. I've gotten some good photos of red and orange leaves, and I'm posting
                    them here for my own viewing pleasure, but I ask that you kindly refrain from
                    viewing the photos as they're my leaves and I've already peeped them.

                    I'm generally opposed to digitally zoomed-in photos, but I broke my own rule
                    and took some on the Mina Sauk Falls trail, because I was worried that the
                    colors wouldn't show well from a distance. This is one part of my journal

                    Mina Sauk Falls is a conditional waterfall, and we saw a portion of it along
                    the trail.
                    The waterfall is only active when there's enough rain, and the climate was
                    relatively dry when we visited, so there was very little water flowing. At
                    first, the "waterfall" just looked like a big cluster of boulders in the woods.
                    We climbed down the rocks and eventually found a pool of running water, and
                    some great views. Unfortunately, I only got pictures of the top of the
                    waterfall, since I left my phone behind when we started bouldering to get down.
