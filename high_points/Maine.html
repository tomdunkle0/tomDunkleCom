                    Mt. Katahdin is a knee-pounding scramble up large boulders for the first half,
                    and the second half features the famous Knife's Edge, one of my personal
                    favorite sections on any high point trail. The Knife's Edge connects Baxter
                    Peak (the highest peak) to Chimney Peak. There are certain sections of it
                    where the drop is steep and you can certainly get hurt if you're not careful.
                    <br><br>
                    The various peaks of Katahdin form a bowl, and as we traversed the Knife's
                    Edge we went clockwise around the bowl. In total, there are three directions
                    that you can reach Baxter Peak from.

                    The area around Baxter State Park boasts many lakes, which also means that
                    it's a humid and buggy environment. We didn't have bug nets for our hats,
                    so at during hours of the day we just had to endure clouds of tiny black
                    flies pelting the face. Luckily, that happened mainly in the evening hours
                    and not during the night. We did also have to put up with it for part of
                    the Helon Taylor Trail, before getting above treeline.

                    Along the Helon Taylor Trail, we got to see a lot of the central Maine
                    landscape once we got above treeline. The weather was sort of cloudy
                    but we never got rained on and it was clear for parts of the day,
                    including while we were at the summit. New England has a way of being
                    unpredictable, so I'm happy that we got what we got.

                    Baxter Peak and Mt. Katahdin are also famous as the northern terminus, or
                    endpoint, of the Appalachian Trail. If you hike the trail south-to-north,
                    it makes for a challenging final section. The sign at Baxter Peak (seen in
                    Figure 8) lists the mileage to Springer Mountain in Georgia, the trail's
                    southern terminus. Although I haven't hiked much of the AT, I've
                    coincidentally been to Springer Mountain because it's very close to where
                    my parents currently live in Georgia.

                    All things considered, I think Mt. Katahdin is my second favorite state high
                    point behind New Mexico, even still as of the current writing (me at 31/50
                    high points). The mountain's crescent shape is perfect and makes for some
                    really fun trails. The scenery is beautiful, and there's a ton of land to
                    explore.

                    Katahdin is a very prominent mountain, especially since the surrounding
                    land is flat and dotted with lakes. It's a fun mountain to climb because
                    the lake views change as you gain altitude and you can see a ton of the
                    surroundings. Just across Golden Rd. from Baxter State Park is the Debsconeag
                    Lakes Wilderness Area, which I haven't been to but it apparently has trails
                    of its own.

                    We camped in a lean-to next to the river at the Roaring Brook Campground,
                    which was a sweet spot. We had to wait several hours to cook dinner the first
                    night since it started raining on our campfire, but the lean-to provided
                    adequate shelter. The lean-to was so nice that we had to define a new class
                    of shelter, called a "McLean-To" to describe it.
                    <br><br>
                    After climbing the mountain and joking about calling Maine residents "Maine
                    Courses" and out-of-towners "Side Dishes" all day, we made sure to get several
                    side dishes (canned beans and corn) from the general store outside the park
                    to have with dinner the second night.
                    <br><br>
                    Due to the photos' vertical size, I saved these couple for last. But I just
                    wanted to point out a section at the beginning of Knife's Edge, where you
                    have to climb straight down a ~20ft wall and then climb straight back up an
                    equally-sized wall to get onto the edge itself. This wasn't too difficult,
                    but I found it funny that this section is a marked 'trail'.
