                    Michigan's upper peninsula has always mystified me, and as I'm writing this
                    I have to admit that it's funny now that I've visited it for this trip and
                    yet I've still never been to mainland Michigan. But it's a really beautiful
                    place.
                    <br><br>
                    Mt. Arvon, the state high point, is arguably not accessible without
                    all-wheel drive capabilities. You can get to the summit if you have a sedan,
                    but you may need to park many miles away and make it a long hike in. Ry and
                    I had rented a Jeep to be able to drive as close to the mountain as possible
                    on this trip. We parked along the Ravine River, and hiked the blue trail to
                    the summit.

                    The blue trail is marked by the trees, though there isn't much of a trail on
                    the ground. We didn't have any problems following it, though. There are some
                    nice waterfalls along the way. The woods in this area felt similar to the
                    woods of my home state of Connecticut, especially in the summertime.

                    At the summit, we found a mailbox register, an informative blue sign, and a
                    High Pointer's Bench. There was a network of trails that roamed the hillside
                    next to the summit, and which provided the greatest vista around.
                    <br><br>
                    The surrounding area, which harbored an active logging industry, had some
                    marshy ponds and an array of colorful trees. It felt remote--even particularly
                    among all of the high points I've been to. I'd like to go back some day, but
                    I just don't know what would bring me there--such is the nature of the place.
