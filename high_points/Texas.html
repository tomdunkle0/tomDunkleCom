                    The Guadalupe Peak trip was described by Ry as "the most disgusting thing
                    I've ever done with my body", in reference to the multiple layers of
                    sunscreen and grime we all acquired over several days. Even in early April,
                    the Guadalupe Mountains are engulfed in a blazing, sunny heat and the only
                    brief salvation is during the night.
                    <br><br>
                    The mountain is right next to El Capitan, a summit that is lower but perhaps
                    more visually spectacular. When you get up to the summit of Guadalupe, you
                    get some nice overhead views of El Capitan in front of the Chihuahan Desert.
                    There is also a trail that goes to the top of El Capitan, but unfortunately
                    I have still never had a chance to climb it.

                    It's so cool how the Guadalupe Mountains contrast with the adjacent Chihuahan
                    Desert. The desert is flat, colorful, and expansive. It looks like an ocean of
                    sand that gets larger the more altitude you gain on the mountain. Many of the
                    hills and curves even look like stationary 'waves' in the ground.
                    <br><br>
                    The day before we climbed Guadalupe Peak, we climbed Hunter Peak as a warm-up,
                    and then we came down through Pine Springs Canyon on the Tejas Trail. That
                    descent is one that I highly recommend.

                    The summit has a large, relatively flat area that a lot of people can walk
                    around on. It was windy the day that we were there, and that made it difficult
                    for us to fly the flag we'd created with a very important message for my
                    friend A.J. (he's one of the ones who originally convinced me to start this
                    whole journey, see the New Hampshire post for more context).
