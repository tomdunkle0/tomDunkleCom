                    West Virginia's high point, Spruce Knob, is located in a picturesque stretch
                    of the Appalachian mountains. The mountains are covered with pine forests, and
                    show a nice combination of green and brown in the summertime.

                    The summit is easily accessible, with a parking lot nearby and a small network
                    of hiking trails around it, plus an observation tower next to the high point.
                    We also went downwards along a nearby trail just to gain some mileage.
                    <br><br>
                    While exploring near the summit, we saw some guys paragliding which was pretty
                    amazing. They jumped from a nearby peak and sat in the sky for a while, just
                    floating around.

                    There were a lot of different mosses growing all over the ground. There were
                    several places in the woods where people had set up makeshift 'couches' and
                    loveseats out of large rock slabs, and then set them around fire pits. At
                    one point, we saw a naturally occurring forest of tiny little ~6-inch tall
                    pine trees. I was delighted to finally understand where car air fresheners
                    come from.

                    We really liked the campsite we'd set up the first night in West Virginia,
                    near the Swallow Rock Campground. The only downside of it was an arguably
                    dangerous bridge that we had to cross each time any of us walked between
                    camp and the cars in the parking lot. I think we're all just happy to have
                    checked off this high point without being killed by that bridge.
                    <br><br>
                    ...or by the bear that presumably wandered through the campsite during the
                    day, which we found some pretty clear 'evidence' of. We packed up the campsite
                    and moved to a different one a couple of miles away.
