                    Colorado's Mt. Elbert was my first 14er, and it's a great climb. As the saying
                    goes, there is no such thing as an easy 14er. But, based on my limited
                    experience I would wager that it is among the easier 14ers. I've done one other
                    that I think is easier (Huron Peak).
                    <br><br>
                    The biggest challenge in Elbert to me was just dealing with the lower oxygen
                    content at its altitudes, but I was already somewhat used to this having been
                    to Colorado several times before. Otherwise, the trail's not very technical and
                    its length and grade compare to other state high points at lower altitudes
                    (e.g. Maine and New Hampshire).

                    The nearby town of Twin Lakes has two (three, actually) adjacent lakes that
                    are consistently visible as you proceed up the Mt. Elbert trail. While gaining
                    altitude, the lakes become farther and farther away and provide several good
                    photo ops.

                    The weather was a perfect sunny summer day, and even though such days almost
                    always include a 2pm thunderstorm in Colorado, this one did not. The Rocky
                    Mountains were almost entirely snow-free.
                    <br><br>
                    We camped nearby the night before, and had the awesome experience of sitting
                    in calm weather and watching a distant thunderstorm happening on a different
                    mountain. I think it's one of the coolest things I've ever seen in nature.
                    Not quite as cool as the northern lights, though.
