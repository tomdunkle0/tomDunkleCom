                    Illinois' Charles Mound is perhaps the high point that is most invasive to its
                    property owners. The geographical marker for the point itself is only about
                    30 feet in front of the front door of their house, and it's a large farm
                    property so you have to hike a mile or so to get to the high point. Although
                    not open to the public year-round, they were nice enough to open it on the
                    weekends during the summer in 2019 when we visited.

                    The high point also has a sign marking it, and a couple of chairs set up
                    to enjoy the view. Since it was only open during summer weekends, there
                    were quite a few people along the trail--I'd say we saw maybe 20 others
                    on the way up and down.

                    Rather than using their driveway to get there, there's a separate hiking trail
                    across the property that you can access by parking along the street at a marked
                    location. The trail runs alongside an unpaved road, then up through some fields
                    alongside a few really swampy ponds. Since we visited in early June, it was
                    buggy and humid out. This high pointing trip was the one where we made heavy
                    use of bug nets and hats.

                    For me, this high point was the first in a blitzkrieg of four: Illinois,
                    Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Michigan. Because accessing the Michigan high point
                    required more than just a sedan, Ry and I had rented a brand new 2019 Jeep
                    Wrangler with about 200 miles on it. We finished the trip with over 2,500.
                    The downside was that after flying into Chicago and picking up the Jeep, I had
                    to find a place to park it in Evanston, the Chicago neighborhood where Ry's
                    sister Haley and her boyfriend lived at the time.
