                    At 6,684 feet above sea level, North Carolina's Mt. Mitchell is the highest
                    point on land in the United States east of the Mississippi River. I climbed
                    this mountain with Ry, and it was the second high point we did in the year
                    2023, after finishing Virginia's Mt. Rogers the day before. The Mt. Mitchell
                    Trail is challenging at six miles long with 3,694 feet of elevation gain.
                    Between the 8 miles we did on Mt. Rogers and the 12 miles we did on Mt.
                    Mitchell, we were pretty tired by the end of this one.

                    We started the day at our campsite, which we had found near (but not in) Black
                    Mountain Campground (which is where the Mt. Mitchell Trail starts). We had been
                    running late the night before when looking for a campsite, so we still had to
                    drive up to the town of Burnsville, North Carolina, to get food and water for
                    the trail. Once we finally got back and hit the trail, it was about 10:15am.

                    We saw some places where complex networks of tree roots grew above the ground.
                    We also saw a lot of trees that had fungi which looked like clams growing on
                    them, so we started referring to those fungi as "tree clams". Much like regular
                    clams, these tree clams will work as currency after the nuclear fallout.

                    There's a wooden post marking every half mile along the Mt. Mitchell Trail. I
                    got photos of all of them from two miles to the end. It's very important that
                    the existence of these wooden posts is documented on the internet. I'm happy to
                    take care of this for us. I've put two of them here, and the rest of them are

                    After crossing a small creek, we started to notice some spots where forest
                    debris (stumps, twigs, leaves, etc.) had been intentionally placed, as a
                    deterrent to people taking shortcuts. This was probably just to keep the trail
                    marked, but I find it funny that it's the sort of barrier you'd see in a 1980s
                    role playing video game.

                    Next, we came across some trees that look like those revolving metal doors you
                    see at train stations. I tried pushing the tree to rotate it, but it didn't
                    move. Usually, those things only rotate in one direction, so I assumed it must
                    work the other way. Rather than spending too much time there, we continued
                    along the trail.

                    There's a cool section of the Mt. Mitchell Trail where you switch back several
                    times up the same hill that an artificial clearing is cut out of for power
                    lines. You get views along this section that are progressively higher, and it's
                    a steep hill. Just before we got to this section, we found a smoked brisket
                    tree that looked like it was just about done. It looked pretty good, but I was
                    saving room for either a bear steak or a concession stand hot dog at the summit

                    When we were near the top of the mountain, we noticed a few huge, wacky-looking
                    boulders. One of them was in a pointy shape that looked like something you'd
                    get with a skew effect in photo editing software. The other one was sort of
                    flat with an overhanging piece that had trees growing out of it.

                    We also found an empty urn (or cookie jar, perhaps?) that somebody left beside

                    any strong storm or wind to knock if over. Maybe the person inside escaped and
                    is roaming the forest?...

                    Mt. Mitchell is the Mt. Washington of the South. Meaning, it's a large mountain
                    that's tough to climb on foot, but there's also a road that goes right to the
                    top and the summit is adorned with a gift shop, a concession stand, a parking
                    lot, etc. So when you finally make it to the summit, you suddenly run into a
                    bunch of tourists that drove right to the top. On most mountains, the summit is
                    the farthest point from civilization. On Mt. Mitchell, we knew that we'd made
                    it back to civilization when we saw the concession stand sign along the trail.
                    In the disappointment of the century, the stand did not sell hot dogs, or even
                    meat of any sort, real or artificial. Just granola bars and coffee. What is
                    this, some sort of joke? But, other mountains don't offer summit hot dogs,
                    either, so it would have felt like cheating.

                    Although we had generally clear weather throughout the day, the summit was the
                    only area that was cloudy, and it was to the point that we had no view of the
                    mountain's surroundings. Even after having visited more than 80% of the
                    country's state high points, I'd say that North Carolina just happened to have
                    the second worst visibility (#1 being Massachussetts) when I visited. I'm sure
                    it's better on some days.
