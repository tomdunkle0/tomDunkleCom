                    New York's Mt. Marcy is in the heart of the Adirondack Range. It likely wins
                    the award for coldest high point that I've been to so far--given the latitude,
                    the time of year and the fact that we had overcast weather that day.

                    It got gradually colder as we proceeded up the mountain. At a certain point,
                    the forest abruptly ended and the wind picked up. It got cold to the point
                    that I was at the absolute low end of my comfort range while dressed in every
                    layer I had with me. The last stretch of the trail from this point wasn't very
                    long, so we quickly hustled up to the summit.
                    <br><br>
                    Once we were there, we noticed that the low temperatures had quickly drained
                    the battery on everybody's phone. I was only able to take the few pictures you
                    see here before my phone died. Sadly, the weather was so overcast that we did
                    not get much of a view from the top, anyway. We hung around on the summit only
                    for a little while, then got moving downwards to get back to relative warmth.

                    There's a really interesting river and bridge early on along the Van Hoevenberg
                    trail. The bridge is signed "High Water Bridge", although the water wasn't very
                    high and the river's boulders were more noteworthy than the river itself. It
                    was pretty cool how the low water level and the high boulder level meant that
                    we could freely move back and forth between sides of the river if we wanted.

                    There was a distinct 'season line' on the mountain, where once we got above
                    a certain altitude, there was active snowfall but below that the trees and
                    the ground were still green. At one point, the season line was clearly visible
                    even on the same trees (Figure 8).
