                    Similar to Kansas and Illinois, Indiana's state high point is located on
                    private land owned by folks nice enough to open it up to the public. The high
                    point is located in a small wooded patch just across the road from their
                    house, and there's a dirt and gravel road established for visitors to park
                    their cars.

                    There's a short little trail that appears to lead somewhere into the woods,
                    but it quickly fades into an undefined woods, and the whole area's small
                    enough that you can tell there's not much else to discover. Still, definitely
                    a nice little enclave.

                    As with many of the more easily accessible high points, there's a High
                    Pointer's Bench at Hoosier Hill. But, this one's different from the
                    others because an animal appears to have been gnawing on a corner of it.
                    Or maybe some foolish kid was sharpening a knife on it? Either way,
                    somebody's been having their way with this bench.

                    After checking off the Indiana state high point, we once again retreated
                    into Ohio to spend the night at the Arrowhead Campground. The funny thing
                    about camping in the midwest close to winter is that not only do established
                    campsites all shut down, but nobody's even there to monitor them so you can
                    just go camp as you please. We claimed a really sweet spot in the woods.
                    <br><br>
                    Having already had a somewhat miserable morning waking up in puddles of mushy,
                    damp ground while getting rained on, we spent the whole evening grimacing
                    over what we expected the following morning to be like. But it was fine.
                    In the morning, Ry got in his car and left for Colorado for the ski season
                    while I got in mine and left for northern Georgia to visit my parents.
