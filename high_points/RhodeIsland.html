                    Before my time in the high-pointing game, Jerimoth Hill was once a somewhat
                    difficult goal to accomplish. The high point, which is just a rock slab
                    in the woods very close to the Connecticut state border, was on land
                    privately owned by a man who was belligerent towards trespassers. He set
                    cameras up on his property, and he'd come out and yell at anyone who entered.
                    The so-called madman of Jerimoth Hill is no longer alive to prevent entry,
                    and the land is now owned by Brown University.
                    <br><br>
                    But even without opposition--I've only been to Jerimoth Hill once, and it was
                    at night. After we finished climbing Mt. Mansfield in Vermont, we decided to
                    drive a two-hour detour to go check off the Rhode Island high point on the
                    way home to Connecticut. Jerimoth Hill is just off of Route 101 as soon as
                    you cross the border from CT into RI.
                    <br><br>
                    Without daylight, we couldn't take in the scene. But I gathered that there was
                    a rock slab in the woods with a register in a nearby metal army box. I got
                    what little photographic evidence I could, and after we signed the register
                    we left the state of Rhode Island almost as quickly as we arrived.
