                    With over 6,000 feet of elevation gain, and a round-trip distance of over
                    22 miles of trail, California's Mt. Whitney was the most difficult mountain
                    I'd climbed so far at the time that I climbed it. Mt. Whitney is the tallest
                    mountain in the contiguous United States, with only certain peaks in Alaska
                    being taller. So far, I consider this my strongest mountaineering achievement.
                    <br><br>
                    This was the first state high point that required two days for us to get to.
                    Some people climb the mountain in one day, but doing so is difficult and
                    requires more experience with the mountain than we had. We decided to play it
                    safe and camp at Consultation Lake, about halfway up the trail, on the first
                    night. Neither of us were experienced in backpacking, so our packs were
                    probably a good 10-20 pounds heavier than they could have been.

                    Whitney's summit is visible for most of the second half of the climb, giving
                    you a constant sense of how far away you are from it. The very last stretch of
                    trail is also gentle--probably one of the easiest parts of the trail, minus
                    the altitude challenges. There's a small shelter at the top, although a sign
                    along the trail warns that the shelter will not protect you from lightning
                    (see Figure 22).
                    <br><br>
                    Perhaps the most famous section of the Mt. Whitney Trail is the "99
                    Switchbacks", which you'll see me continually refer to in quotes because there
                    aren't actually 99 of them, but either 97 or 98 depending on how sharp a
                    'switchback' is. The point is, the trail climbs a very steep slope up to the
                    top of the ridge by switching back almost a hundred times.

                    While ascending the switchbacks, there are times that the drop from one leg of
                    the trail to the next gets steep. Much of the trail is next to some
                    discomforting cliffs. I do think that the switchbacks were the most difficult
                    section of the trail, but I didn't find them as difficult as I was expecting.
                    At the top of the switchbacks, we proceeded to the Trail Crest which leads you
                    across the sloped backside of the ridge.
                    <br><br>
                    Next to the 99 Switchbacks is "The Chute", a steep slope that's usually covered
                    in snow, and serves as an alternative path of ascent for times of the year when
                    the switchbacks are under the snow. People also sometimes glissade down the
                    chute to get down the mountain faster (plenty of YouTube videos of this).
                    However, 2021 was an especially light snow year for all of California, so even
                    though it was early June we were able to traverse the whole trail without
                    having to cross any snow.

                    Ry and I both agreed that Consultation Lake was the coolest place we'd ever
                    camped, as difficult as it was to get to. I liken the effort to carrying a
                    heavy pack up 400 flights of stairs. It was a stop-and-go effort, and when we
                    finally got to the campsite and set up, neither of us did much besides sit and
                    look at the water for a bit, then disappear into our tents for a much needed
                    10-11 hours of sleep.
                    <br><br>
                    Each campsite at Conservation Lake is set on a ledge overlooking the lake.
                    Later on, we practiced bouldering by climbing up and down the ledges to get to
                    and from the lake's edge. There were several large fish in the lake, darting
                    about.
                    <br><br>
                    Although there are designated sites to set up camp at along Conservation Lake,
                    I took advantage of a conveniently shaped spot for my tent partially
                    underneath a giant boulder that created a small sort of cave. The spot turned
                    out to be perfect, and I didn't have to deal with much wind at night.

                    The front of the ridge is steep--even sheer cliffs at many points including
                    on one side of the Whitney summit. At several points along the trail, there
                    are notches that you can look through and see a drop down of several thousand
                    feet. The notches provided some of my favorite pictures, though I have trouble
                    looking straight down these in person. It's a long, long way down.
                    <br><br>
                    The trail on the ridge starts out with more sheer cliffs, only they're even
                    higher than the ones on the 99 Switchbacks. As we proceeded, the cliffs
                    gradually became steep slopes and then less steep slopes, with Mt. Whitney
                    itself being a low enough grade that you could probably scramble up it
                    from that side if you really wanted to, but you'd also have to get to that
                    side of the mountain in the first place which isn't easy.
