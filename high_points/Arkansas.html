                    Arkansas' Mount Magazine is a wide one, with enough height to produce the view
                    in the panorama above, yet enough breadth for that vantage point to be removed
                    from the true summit, which is deemed Signal Hill. It's a very short hike from
                    the viewpoint to the top, though, and this is one of those mountains where
                    it's up to you how much distance you want to cover when you climb, or 'climb'
                    it. If you want to just see the top, drive to the parking lot and walk five
                    minutes. Or you can take several miles to get there on various trails.

                    Signal Hill is a clearing in the woods that is marked with a large sign.
                    On the ground is an impressive stone representation of the state of Arkansas,
                    including a mark showing the location of Mount Magazine in the state. Signal
                    Hill can be reached via several different trails in the park's network.

                    The summit of the mountain has both a campground and a fancy three-story lodge,
                    so if you want to stick it out up there you have your choice of amenities. If
                    I had more time to explore this area, I wouldn't mind camping up there, or
                    renting a room in the lodge and pitching a tent in the hallway just to be
                    ironic.

                    I say this, though, and coincidentally the area around Mount Magazine has
                    become a regular step for me, because I have camped at the nearby Cove Lake
                    several times while travelling distances via car during the pandemic. Would
                    highly recommend.
