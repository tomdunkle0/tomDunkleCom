                    Clingmans Dome is the tallest mountain and the highest point in Great Smoky
                    Mountains National Park, and in the state of Tennessee. Much like other
                    Appalachian high points, there's a network of trails surrounding it, so you
                    can pick and choose where you want to start from and how long you want your
                    approach to be. I started from Newfound Gap, a viewpoint along route 441 that
                    has a large parking lot, and is connected to Clingmans Dome via 7.9 miles of
                    the Appalachian Trail. I managed to fill almost all available daylight with
                    this climb. It took me seven and a half hours, from 8:30am to 4:00pm.

                    Not too long after I got started, I came to a beech forest enclosure
                    showcasing some pig-proof technology. A helpful sign explained that the area's
                    plants are vulnerable to wild hogs. The solution is to build a fence that
                    keeps the hogs out--the fence is on an incline, and an open grated platform
                    is built horizontally, so as to allow a person to walk right over the fence.
                    A hog, however, would likely be afraid to walk on the grated surface due to
                    its smaller feet. I'm assuming a hog would think that way, but I haven't been
                    one before, so I'm not entirely sure.

                    Since I started from so far away, I had to cross two foothills before climbing
                    Clingmans Dome itself. This meant that I had a lot of elevation change, as I
                    had to go up, down, up, down, and up again--then, the opposite way in reverse
                    when going back to my car. Signs along the Appalachian Trail continually
                    remind you of how far away you are.

                    At the summit of Clingmans Dome is an observation tower architected such that
                    a spiral-shaped concrete walkway leads to the top of the tower. The summit
                    was crowded when I got there, and I get the impression that's usually the
                    case, but that it may have been extra crowded the day I was there since it
                    was during the Thanksgiving weekend.

                    The trail was mostly wooded, since the Appalachians aren't typically high
                    enough to have a treeline. Certain points along the trail were very wooded,
                    to the point that minimal sunlight entered the woods and it felt
                    dark even during the day.

                    Because the trail was so wooded, there were not many scenic views along the
                    way. One specific point, shown in Figures 15 and 16, was the only standout
                    besides what I was able to see from the observation tower on the summit. The
