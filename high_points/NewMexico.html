                    As of the current writing (31/50 high points), I consider New Mexico's
                    Wheeler Peak to be both the most difficult and my favorite personal
                    high point that I've achieved. I've had to process more pain in climbing this
                    mountain than any other--both during and after the climb. For that reason, I
                    think I've learned the most from it.

                    Right after we passed Williams Lake, we came to a hill in the woods
                    and suddenly the trail got steep. Really, really steep. Then, tree line
                    abruptly occurred, leaving us to continue climbing upwards slowly for about
                    a mile. We spent this mile on steep, exposed and snowy slopes, moving
                    by kicking little 'stairs' into the mountainside with our snowshoes.
                    <br><br>
                    We were also struggling to stay on the trail using a digital
                    map, since the trail itself was submerged in snow. So, we sort of invented a
                    path that went back and forth along the mountainside until we reached the top.
                    It was painfully slow work, but finally we reached a ledge where I took the
                    photo in Figure 3, which is likely my favorite photograph I've ever taken.
                    From that point, it was pretty smooth sailing to the top. On the way, we
                    passed New Mexico's highest mountain goat.

                    The one good thing about having to kick all of those staircases into the snow
                    was that when descending we actually knew where we were going. Still, it was
                    hard work and by the time we were back down at Williams Lake, I remember
                    feeling that my body was in a state of physical exhaustion beyond most if not
                    absolutely anything I'd pushed it through before.
                    <br><br>
                    We also both got gnarly sunburns--mine the worst I've ever had. Huge moral
                    here, if you are climbing a mountain covered in snow be absolutely sure you
                    have not just sunscreen on but <b>fabric</b> protection of everything including
                    your face. I went through quite a bit of lagging pain after I finished this
                    high point.
