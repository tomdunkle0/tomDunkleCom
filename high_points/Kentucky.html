                    Black Mountain, the highest peak in Kentucky, is right next to the state border
                    between Kentucky and Virginia. The mountain is unique among high points in that
                    there is no clear way to climb it on foot. There's no established hiking trails
                    on it that I'm aware of, and the forest on and around it is dense enough that
                    you don't want to bushwhack it, unless you're really looking for an adventure.
                    <br><br>
                    However, Kentucky state route 160 traverses the mountain and into Virginia, and
                    the road can be used to access the summit. Near the summit, there's a dirt road
                    called Black Mountain Ridge Road that connects route 160 to the mountain's
                    summit. If you don't want to drive all the way up, you can park at the bottom
                    of Black Mountain Ridge Road and walk up to the top (a little over a mile each
                    way).

                    The summit of the mountain is vaguely accessible. There's a bunch of equipment
                    that is maintained and used by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA),
                    including a large, ominous-looking radar dome. Much of the premises is fenced
                    off and covered in warning signs telling you not to enter. However, I believe
                    the summit itself is open to the public as long as you don't try to wander
                    into any buildings or over any fences.
                    <br><br>
                    There's a plaque at the top honoring William Risden, a cable TV innovator that
                    did much of his work around Black Mountain. The area is densely forested, and
                    like most of Kentucky it's continually raining and never feels dry. We found
                    some bright orange lizards several times, one of which is pictured in
                    Figure 7.
                    <br><br>
                    Sometime in the future, I want to come back and see if I can figure out a way
                    to properly climb this mountain on foot, though doing so is low on my list.
