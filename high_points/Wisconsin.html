                    Out of all of the state high points, Wisconsin's definitely wins the award
                    for best adjacent restaurant. The Hill of Beans is a bed and breakfast with
                    great t-shirts and even better food, and it sits just on the other side of
                    Bass Lake from Timms Hill, the state high point.

                    There's an ~two-story tall wooden observation tower at the summit of Timms
                    Hill, with a high pointer's register mailbox at the base. Not far from here
                    is the obligatory High Pointer's Bench. The observation tower provides a
                    360 degree view of the lush, green central Wisconsin landscape surrounding
                    what amounts to little more than a hill of beans.

                    Flat as it may be, Wisconsin has some really nice forest coverage and it's
                    a great place to be outdoors in the summer. If I lived here I would probably
                    be more into lake activities (boating, fishing, kayaking, etc.) than I am.
                    <br><br>
                    I got a kick out of the fact that one of the most popular gas station chains
                    is called Krist. We kept joking about searching for Krist whenever we started
                    running low on gas.

                    As cultured of a district as Timms Hill appears to be, it is not without its
                    troublemakers. A helpful and informative sign warned us that bringing horses
                    onto the swimming beach was strictly forbidden, and that anybody who broke
                    the rule risked the communal consequence of getting horses banned from the
                    land established around this hill of beans.

                    If I were in my homeland, I'd go down fighting for the right to bring my horse
                    to the swimming beach. But I was a guest in this land, and I wasn't going to
                    question their lifestyles.

                    There's a strong technicality on the date I've logged for summitting this high
                    point. Having left Chicago on the morning of June 1st and made a quick stop
                    at Charles Mound (the Illinois state high point), we arrived at Timms Hill
                    late in the evening and ventured onto it out of curiosity before coming back
                    and setting up camp for the night. We then returned in the morning to take
                    more daylight photographs. So, the majority of the photos you see here are
                    from June 2nd, but June 1st was the day we truly summited the high point for
                    the first time.
