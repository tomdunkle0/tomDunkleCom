                    North Dakota's high point, White Butte, has both one of the funniest and most
                    accurate names of any high point. White Butte is made of light grey and white
                    soil and juts out of flat farmland in southwestern North Dakota. The rest of
                    the landscape is somewhere between the amber waves and an ominous inland
                    aesthetic. It's like being in the Great Plains, but as we joked it felt like
                    we might get attacked by bandits. We did not.

                    I visited the butte with my friends Ry and Aaron. We had just high-pointed
                    South Dakota, and although we still wanted to do other things there, we
                    spent the afternoon and evening of one day driving up to North Dakota just
                    for its high point, and dinner. It took about three hours each way to cover
                    the distance, plus a stop on the way up to pick up some liquor for the coming
                    night. We got to the butte with no time to spare, as the whole process of
                    summitting and returning took about an hour, and it was the last hour of
                    daylight that we had. But we did it, and got some good photos. Upon arriving
                    at the parking lot, we immediately found some cool views of certain parts of
                    the butte.

                    Several hundred feet from the parking lot was a herd of black cows. I took
                    some pictures of them from a distance, and after we started climbing the butte,
                    I noticed that whenever we looked back the cows seemed to be closer to the
                    parking lot. They must have been looking out of curiosity to see what kind of
                    car Aaron drives.

                    After a few minutes on the trail, there's a fork where you're supposed to
                    take a left and go up the hill, but we initially took a right and found
                    a dead end in a valley surrounded by the largest walls the butte has to
                    offer. The walls are detailed, featured, and a bright white color. It looks
                    like it would be fun to climb straight up, but this is a delicate area on
                    private land, so we didn't try.

                    After we turned around and went the correct way, the trail brought us up
                    a somewhat Tolkeinian hill that I would say was the steepest part of the
                    hike. The sign at the trailhead had warned us of rattlesnakes. It was too
                    cold out when we visited for snakes to have been hanging out on the surface,
                    but I figured that this hill is where they'd be the most dangerous if you
                    did encounter one (side note--I've been rattled at by a rattlesnake near my
                    home in central Texas before. Kind of cool, but scary as hell). At the top
                    of the hill, the trail follows the ridgeline up to the summit.

                    There's a small forest hidden on the side of the butte opposite the parking
                    lot, i.e. you don't see the forest until you're close enough to the top to
                    see over the ridge. Since we visited in late September, the forest was in
                    the process of changing colors. After arriving at the summit, we went down
                    to a lower ledge to drink our summit beers and get photos of the North Dakotan
                    sunset over the forest.
