                    One day after class, I walked into the bar at the Nathan Hale Inn,
                    on the UConn campus, with my friends A.J. and Keval. A.J.'s in the center
                    of the group photo, with two thumbs up. We were brainstorming for 'New
                    England bucket list' items, since I was planning to move from Connecticut
                    to Texas about six months later.
                    <br><br>
                    Naturally, climbing the tallest mountain in the northeast came up, and it
                    was one or two ideas that ultimately came to fruition during my last few
                    months in the area. The other was a trip to Montreal, which was an entirely
                    different adventure and doesn't yet have an interactive web app devoted to it.
                    I'm using the word 'yet' in technical rather than storytelling terms. We can
                    talk numbers if you want to pay me to make it, but it's going to involve
                    designing ten boss battles to cover each of the wizards we met on that trip.
                    <br><br>
                    Speaking of wizards, the seven people that summited Mt. Washington with me
                    are shown in Figure X. It's still the largest group that I've ever visited
                    a high point with.

                    We showed up around midnight at a trailhead somewhere
                    in New Hampshire a few miles from the mountain on the first night. Right
                    after we got there, it started pouring rain and we had to

                    Mt. Washington has several false summits in series, which is funny in retrospect
                    considering how inexperienced we were. At one point, we rounded a corner
                    to discover yet another false summit, to which Lars proclaimed, "This is stupid!".
                    <br><br>
                    Inexperienced as we were, we also had great senses of humor, so we invented
                    a signature snack to enjoy (or more accurately, make fun of) on the way up
                    the mountain. The snack was called the "Crappy Mt. Washington Snack", or
                    "Crappy Mt. Washington Sandwich", depending on its size. It consisted of
                    a Nature Valley granola brick and a Snickers bar rolled up like a taco in
                    a slice of white Wonder bread. It was terrible, but in my 23-year-old mind
                    it gave me the calories that I needed to keep going. Now, as a 28-year-old,
                    I just exercise the same thought process with slightly less terrible food.

                    Towards the end of the climb, the trail disappeared and the very top
                    became an open rock scramble of boulders about the size of Dirt Devil
                    vacuum cleaners. I live for this stuff now, but I was definitely feeling
                    drained of energy by this point on that day. It's a strenuous feature to have
                    as the final stretch, but it's less technical and less scary than the final
                    stretches of most mountains of similar overall difficulty that I've climbed.
                    <br><br>
                    The rock scramble was also the busiest section of the trail, as most climbers
                    tended to slow down going both up and down. Luckily, one cool thing about
                    this section is that there isn't one path you need to follow. The trail
                    sort of opens up into this big, free and open field of rocks and you can
                    choose to take whatever path you want to in order to get to the top. So, we
                    didn't really run into problems with queuing or having to wait for people.

                    Around this section is where we started seeing really cool
                    things happening on Tuckerman's Ravine. Namely, clouds were rolling quickly
                    across the top of the ravine, routinely coming into direct contact with
                    the ground at the very top.
                    <br><br>
                    The ravine is notorious for its difficulty among skiiers and snowboarders.
                    There's plenty of videos on YouTube of people riding it both successfully
                    and unsuccessfully. Additionally, the mountain itself is famous for erratic
                    weather and is where some of the fastest wind speeds on Earth have ever been
                    recorded, outside the context of a storm. It was pretty windy on the summit
                    the day we were there, but it didn't seem like anything out of the ordinary.

                    There was only one small patch of grass along the scramble, in which Chris
                    and I took a break to have some more crappy Mt. Washington snacks. I was
                    pretty tired at this point, but just stoked to know that we were close.
                    Once our hunger for ill-conceived snacks was satisfied, we strapped up and
                    finished climbing to the top.
                    <br><br>
                    I'm not sure my words are powerful enough to describe how ridiculous a sight
                    it is when you step onto the top of Mt. Washington. It's the only state high
                    point that's both (a.) a strenuous and difficult climb to achieve on foot,
                    and (b.) completely accessible to the public since there's a paved road to
                    the top. I'm sure you've seen the bumper stickers: "This car climbed Mt.
                    Washington."
                    <br><br>
                    It's not just that the summit is publicly accessible. The summit is basically
                    a big shopping plaza with a parking lot, gift shop, coffee shop, cafeteria
                    serving burgers, fries, pizza, etc... It's hilarious. After we finished
                    scrambling up the rocks to the top, we stepped up onto the perfectly
                    right-angled edge of a paved road and took in the sight of it all.
