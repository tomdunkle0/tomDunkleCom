Known Issues
-----

The following are issues I've identified while migrating the project into this git repository:

 * The video file for Walking Up Hills, episode 1, which is normally found at high_points/nv/walking_up_hills_ep_01.mp4, is 1.5GB, which is too large to host on github.
 * All of the audio files in deersim/audio are in .wav format, and consequently one of the files (startlinglyYOURFEARISREALinanothertime.wav) is over 100MB, making it too large to host on github without using large file storage (LFS).
