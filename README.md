Known Issues
-----

The following are issues I've identified while migrating the project into this git repository:

 * All of the audio files in deersim/audio are in .wav format, and consequently one of the files (startlinglyYOURFEARISREALinanothertime.wav) is over 100MB, making it too large to host on github without using large file storage (LFS).
